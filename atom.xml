    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s not much to this post. Being back in Perth I saw a few of his paintings. Made me want to put some effort into learning to draw again. We&rsquo;ll see if that happens.</p>

<p>I also found a post about Dave Devries work where he takes sketches of monsters drawn by children and paits them realistically. His book is called “<a href="http://www.themonsterengine.com/">The Monster Engine</a>”. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome, but as my friend said, isn&rsquo;t this infringing on the poor childrens hard work? :P</p>

In the few short days it took to do this, we&#8217;d had problems with only two vans. Little did I know the mechanical workout I was going to get before this trip was over.&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact there was a lot of time spent on the phone to my old man or one of his friends and a lot of crash courses on different parts of the engine. Poor guys.&nbsp;We also got some soccer in, I got some rock climbing in, there was the compulsory snorkling (which I didn&#8217;t do) and a fair bit of camping. I was impressed with their campfire cooking. I didn&#8217;t know that&nbsp;zucchinis&nbsp;could be so delicious. And I found out that you can&#8217;t use garlic and onion together. Crazy Italians. I Also learnt&nbsp;that &#8220;it&#8217;s never too early for goon&#8221;.&nbsp;And Me and Romain spend or first night sleeping in the 4WD so that the new couple could get some space together. I also saw bioluminescence&nbsp;in the water for my first time that I remember although I have no idea how that could be the case since I&#8217;ve seen it everywhere since.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-patNEdc3xzA/UKYAQOlpIEI/AAAAAAAAGXM/O2qxBqMSZhs/s1600/IMG068.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-patNEdc3xzA/UKYAQOlpIEI/AAAAAAAAGXM/O2qxBqMSZhs/s320/IMG068.jpg" width="320" /></a><br />On the way to&nbsp;Nanutara road house it was our turn for the van to break down. We fixed it by temporarily replacing the fuse with a bolt before limping to the road house (and later to Tom Price). When we got there, we&nbsp;randomly meeting some friends of mine who were a bit shocked to see me wandering around in the middle of nowhere without shoes or a shirt.<br /><br />Tom Price was one place I&#8217;d really been looking forward to. When we got there I spent a while running around my old hood. I checked out my old house and climbed the tree I used to climb each night as a kid after my jog around the oval. I also talked to an old mate on the phone but we couldn&#8217;t arrange a meeting in the end. Then when we camped at Kings Lake, I went for a walk up the hill between there and my house looking for thunder eggs and the old caves that I used to explore. It was a lot harder to find them in the dark but I found a few. I also hoped to find some honey like we used to but no dice.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iScQ5z1qUB4/UKS-rWJfM5I/AAAAAAAAGXw/bLh8Nan2C2o/s1600/IMG008.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iScQ5z1qUB4/UKS-rWJfM5I/AAAAAAAAGXw/bLh8Nan2C2o/s320/IMG008.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Before going to Karajini the Italian couple dropped off their van to get repaired. We could still camp together as a group. The first day was Fortescue&nbsp;falls and I learnt how to play Dixit. A game I suck at. The next day&nbsp;I even got to climb Mt. Bruce for sunrise thanks to Cedric. It meant a lot. It probably seems cheesy but my old man took me to the top of Mt. Bruce on the dawn of my 13th birthday and as the sun rose told me that now I&#8217;m a man and something poetic to do with being high up. He&#8217;s always been far more poetic than I (can you tell with that&nbsp;eloquent&nbsp;description?). But it meant a lot to be able to do this again before I left. And when we left, the Italian borrowed the girls van and went to pick up theirs. We got to the meeting place and waited. And waited. And eventually found out that they had gone to fuel up at Tom Price&#8217;s only fuel station only to have the car next to them catch on fire and they had to wait until the service station opened for business again.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SJxh7emF_KY/UKX5oODLB5I/AAAAAAAAGXk/1TAhpoZff8k/s1600/IMG088-002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SJxh7emF_KY/UKX5oODLB5I/AAAAAAAAGXk/1TAhpoZff8k/s320/IMG088-002.jpg" width="240" /></a>When they caught up, me and Romain parted ways to go to Port Hedland for the night to stay with some family of mine. My uncle has backyard bar there. I&nbsp;wish I had some pics of it. It has a lot of character. The bar itself is a nice timber log places on top of a snake aquarium with a sea snake skin on the back wall and great quotes scattered around the bar in various marker pens. I got killed in pool by their children, as expected. We also watched some Aboriginal girls fishing. It was interesting watching them sitting with the VB throwing the lines in, pulling them up with a fish, taking a swig, leaving the fish to flop about and then throwing the line back in. They&#8217;re far better fisherman then I.<br /><br />Between Port Hedland and Broome we stopped for a night to celebrate the Italians&nbsp;anniversary. I have a note here &#8220;I should never have explained double pluggers to them&#8221;.<br /><br />We finished out time together as a group in Broome at Max and Fleur&#8217;s house for a few nights. They&#8217;re family friends from way back and have been having couch surfers stay with them for ages. They had some great storys and the best feature wall of any house I&#8217;ve seen. A <b>huge</b>&nbsp;world map. They were really warm and staying with them and their children was great. Even if the boys relished in showing me up on the trampoline. We had a good last night with as all enjoying ourselves over a few drinks. First at the beach and then at the house. Sadly, I was just really getting to know a few of the group and me and Romain would be splintering off early the next morning. He had three days to catch a flight in Darwin to see his mother so off we went. Or so we thought.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YMDzhLQe_7g/UKS_S99I-DI/AAAAAAAAGX8/nrbfGdsQUVU/s1600/IMG017.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YMDzhLQe_7g/UKS_S99I-DI/AAAAAAAAGX8/nrbfGdsQUVU/s320/IMG017.jpg" width="240" /></a>The next morning saw me driving. God know&#8217;s why. That was rare so I&#8217;m guessing Romain must of been pretty hungover. We made it as far as… nope we didn&#8217;t even make it past the Derby turn of. The car just stopped. It was kind of hard to give more of a description than that because we were talking and listing to music but the car just seemed to loose all power and stop. Romain had no mechanical knowledge and all I wanted to do was sleep. It sucked. Slowly we had people stop and look over the car. And I harassed poor Max and my old man. They must have been getting sick of me by now. Everyone came to the same conclusion. There was no spark at the distributer. It was probably dodgy wiring or the coil. We had no tools or circuit diagram and I didn&#8217;t really have the patience for someones idea of using a 12V light and some wire to test different parts of the wiring. So, we hailed cars until someone was happy to tow us to Derby. It was quite the experience since neither of us had been towed before (and Romain had recently been in a car accident with someone else at the wheel), and I didn&#8217;t expect to be travelling at 110 km/hr with a tow rope this short. But, we were pretty happy as we pulled up and fate being the way it is a girl walked past and gave us her husbands number since he was a mobile mechanic. That night we splurged and had a pub counter meal before Romain decided he wanted to go fishing. I wanted to sleep so I convinced him we should push the van there. The Jetty really isn&#8217;t close but we made it a fair way.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WN0nBMCGCI0/UKS_q1-osKI/AAAAAAAAGYM/lV-DFPjoq_Y/s1600/IMG028.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WN0nBMCGCI0/UKS_q1-osKI/AAAAAAAAGYM/lV-DFPjoq_Y/s320/IMG028.jpg" width="320" /></a>The next morning, fate being the way it is, the mobile mechanic messaged us just before lunch to tell us that he didn&#8217;t have the time. A morning wasted. We learned a few things after we got to Derby:</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1">Derby isn&#8217;t the best place to get repairs done. Funnily my old man did call to tell us that. It was as we were undoing the tow rope.</li><li class="li1">Small towns cook horrible seafood.</li><li class="li1">French people are horribly snobby when it comes to food. Wait… only to food?</li><li class="li1">You shouldn&#8217;t tow an automatic a long way or quickly without taking out the tailshaft.</li><li class="li1">It&#8217;s a long way to the wharf and probably too far to push a van that doesn&#8217;t work. We made it half way though.</li></ol><div class="p1"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R4Yt6D7ziRQ/UKTAEFe8CtI/AAAAAAAAGYQ/2wtqcJ0zPik/s1600/IMG030.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R4Yt6D7ziRQ/UKTAEFe8CtI/AAAAAAAAGYQ/2wtqcJ0zPik/s320/IMG030.jpg" width="240" /></a>We eventually found someone who could fit us in but Romain wasn&#8217;t sure he could get to Darwin in time so we decided that it might be best if he arranged a bus ticket and I drove the van to Darwin. I was also meant to renew the vehicle registration but there were a few complications with this and it looked like it was going to be simpler for me to &#8220;buy&#8221; the van off him and then &#8220;sell&#8221; it back to him. In the end we didn&#8217;t and it soon became unregistered with amusing consequences. The goodbye that night was interesting because we were both in a less than perfect situations, tired and we&#8217;d known each other only ten days. The following morning the car (surprisingly) got fixed and I started driving it to Darwin, alone, but something seemed strange with the gearbox. Again, this has consequences down the line.</div></div>

I can&#8217;t think of a good song for these events but this song was stuck in my head a lot just before I left.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>There&#8217;s a bit of an overlap with this post and <a href="http://bodeystravels.blogspot.com/2012/07/day-1-good-start.html">Day 1</a> and <a href="http://bodeystravels.blogspot.com/2012/07/day-2-3-getting-to-carnarvon-and.html">Day 2 &amp; 3</a>. I hope it&#8217;s not too much. I wrote it trying to keep myself awake one night shift on the boat.<br /><br />I&#8217;d spent my last few nights (or weeks I believe) at Paz&#8217;s house with Dougy and Esu. I&#8217;d had a really great few weeks with them. Actually, I had a great time with everyone I stayed with before I left. (I may have slipped past the point that I&#8217;d been &#8220;homeless&#8221; for my last year before I left Perth. Well, I was living out my car. Mostly housesitting or renting short term). I&#8217;d convinced Paz, Dougy and Esu all to drive me north (Much to Dougy&#8217;s chagrin since his car was on it&#8217;s last legs) to drop me off just west of Joondalup so that I could start hitching out of Perth. Miraculously, this fine Saturday morning there was a break in the rain.<br /><br />I said goodbyes waved and watched the car leave before heading off north. I like to walk when I&#8217;m hitch hiking. There&#8217;s something about walking that I find relaxing. It also gives a sense of&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;something, which is a nice contrast to everyone driving past. So I walked. And walked. And doubted. It had been a while since I was hitch hiking and I&#8217;d forgotten the golden rule. Just after you start to doubt and wonder if this was a good idea or will anyone stop, someone does and so someone did. Off I was. One of the things hitchhiking is that everyone has a story. I&#8217;d like to list them here but they go in some other posts.<br /><br />I find that keeping up your end of the bargin (entertaining the driver) is the hardest part of hitchhiking for me. Not because it&#8217;s hard, but because often you&#8217;ve just woken up from the side of the road with a&nbsp; few hours sleep. And this is what happened that first night. I&#8217;d turned down the offer of going somewhere to sleep and decided to trek on. Next thing I knew there are howling dogs, a cold breeze and no windbreak and all my clothes were wet because I&#8217;d decided to leave instead of waiting for them to dry. Did I mention that I&#8217;d decided last minute that the tent and sleeping back weren&#8217;t needed and were to large to bother with in the pack? Then the only bush i could find to supplement my pack as a windbreak with was filled with rats. Well… that was day one over. And yet, being free and travelling these things weren&#8217;t a problem.<br /><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The next day brought me the rest of the way to Carnavon where I&#8217;d planned on catching up with one of the Taiwanese backpackers that had worked on the vineyard my dad manages. There hospitality was amazing I took a day off here to set up the pack (and you know, dry out the washing).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G0EcHuTP94c/UKX-Brgj0wI/AAAAAAAAGWA/NWAX-KhndZg/s1600/IMG051.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G0EcHuTP94c/UKX-Brgj0wI/AAAAAAAAGWA/NWAX-KhndZg/s320/IMG051.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Setting out from there I made it a while before getting a lift from a&nbsp;Mauritian&nbsp;bloke going to Coral Bay. He was nice guy. We talked easily for most of the trip. He offered to take me into Coral Bay and I turned down the lift so he dropped me at the turn off and I tried to get a lift the rest of the day. No luck.<br /><br />That night I walked back to the road house to get some food and then hit the bush to find a place out of the view of oncoming traffic to get some shut eye. In Carnarvon I&#8217;d buckled and bought a cheap sleeping bag. The next morning it was wet and I was cold. Dammit! :P After getting up I walked to the road house to get some food and it was here I saw a guy looking lost.&nbsp;I don&#8217;t usually hang out at road houses and harass the customers&nbsp;but two days sleeping ill prepared on the side of the road was enough for me at the time.&nbsp;Then just as I was about to ask him for a lift,&nbsp;he drove off. Thankfully he didn&#8217;t drive too far before he pulled over. I ran over to him to ask where he was going. It turned out to be Coral Bay. Great! I wanted to get to Darwin as fast as possible. There were three boat races heading north and the first was starting now. There was only a short window. I was desperate though. &#8220;Where are you going after that?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Karijini&#8221; he said in a French accent. This was the one place I did want to see heading north (I spent a fair amount of time growing up growing up nearby and I still have quite an attachment to the place) but I didn&#8217;t think I would have the time to spare and hitchhiking there was (I assumed) fair from simple or easy. I decided that if he was going back onto my route after this then it would be worth the delay. He was. Port Hedland and then Broome. Even better, he had a plane flight he had to catch in Darwin so we wouldn&#8217;t be delayed too long. It was further in the future than ideal, but I would be able to see Karajini!! I exchanged names with Romain and jumped in the van. It turned out that he was travelling with four other cars. So now, including myself, nine people in total. We hung out in Coral bay for the rest of the day playing soccer and swimming. He was a decent guy and I didn&#8217;t know it then but we were going to become good friends.</div></div>

I love backpackers. Butter, her boyfriend and their friends are great. Now I just need to work out what to get them as thanks. People that say &#8220;nothing&#8221; suck&nbsp;<img goomoji="softbank_ne_jp.329" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/e/softbank_ne_jp.329" style="background-color: white; font-family: arial; font-size: small; margin: 0px 0.2ex; vertical-align: middle;" /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So, I woke up yesterday morning and wrote out the last post, then did some Korean study, packed my things that had left my bag and started walking down the road with my thumb out. It wasn&#8217;t too long until someone felt sorry for me and turned their car around to pick me up. Actually, I felt sorry for them. With the amount of sleep I&#8217;d had the night before, there was no way I was going to be great company. Luckily, he loved talking so we did fairly well. I convinced him to stop at one of the road houses so that I could have a real brunch unlike the two kiddie sized chocolate bars I&#8217;d had for breakfast. Needless to say, I&#8217;ve spent most of today preparing. Making sure all my clothes are clean and packed, buying a cheap sleeping bad and throwing away half the crap that made it&#8217;s way into my bag. Well… mostly it&#8217;s just half of my first aid kit and spending the $47 in loose change I was somehow carting around.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tssRFqYmFYE/T_wwZWTq4UI/AAAAAAAAEeo/I9s3_cnT8fA/s1600/IMG049.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tssRFqYmFYE/T_wwZWTq4UI/AAAAAAAAEeo/I9s3_cnT8fA/s320/IMG049.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I suck at poker</td></tr></tbody></table>I digress, back to the bloke who picked me up. He had a daughter who jumped straight in the back of the car giving me the front seat. I never know how to handle that too well but it&#8217;s the norm so you just kind of mutter out a thanks. The bloke who picked me up was a Kiwi with a pet hate for the rivalry between the two countries. He educated me on a few points that I haven&#8217;t bothered to check, like Farlap being from New Zealand and told me a fair bit about Carnarvon. He loved smoking, could no longer drink and had hitch hiked along the west and east coast when he was younger along with having done a bit of squatting. He&#8217;d apparently once done it with two guys who murdered someone who picked them up just for the cash in their wallets. Apparently you wouldn&#8217;t of picked that they were capable of it but they were easily stupid enough to do something that…. stupid. So, after a brief stop at the cemetery, he gave me a tour of the town and dropped me off at my friends house.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I&#8217;ve now spent one night here and plan on heading off early tomorrow morning. It&#8217;s raining now (my jumper was on the line outside) but should be clearing up by the morning. Wait! The rains stopped! I might try and get some stuff done in town before it starts up again!<br /><br />Oh. The plan is to stop in Dampier, Port Hedland, South Hedland, Broome and then&#8230; well I&#8217;ll sort that out then. That is, presuming the plan hasn&#8217;t changed by then.</div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<br /><div class="p1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oRFHH0ij6Pg/Si45Oz00twI/AAAAAAAABFY/TLZVxmIeJWM/s1600/n591195959_303442_195.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oRFHH0ij6Pg/Si45Oz00twI/AAAAAAAABFY/TLZVxmIeJWM/s320/n591195959_303442_195.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me at the Gravity Center for the Magic 8-Ball trip.</td></tr></tbody></table>Ah! It&#8217;s good to be moving. I woke up at some ungodly hour to do my tax and pack. Then Esu, Dougy and I drove to T&#8217;s before heading to my hitching point near Muchea. It took very little time for my first lift to pick me up.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">He was a guy from south England somewhere and was going to the gravity centre in Gingin. He&#8217;d been to most of the tourist sites in Perth and couldn&#8217;t wait for the two years until his contract was up fast enough. He dropped me in Gingin and we bonded over how things closed too early in Perth and that the living wasn&#8217;t dense enough. The standard stuff.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The next guy was a year younger than me (although he thought I was younger). He had a bunch of tattoos (some of which he&#8217;d done), built custom bikes (the reason he&#8217;d been in Perth), worked as a DJ, had done some work in security and was now working in the airport. He&#8217;d also travelled a surprising amount of Australia. He dropped me at the Geraldton maccas (so cheap) at two pm but said he could drop me off at a backpackers. I&#8217;m now on the side of the road somewhere north of there. Grumpy is probably a word that would come to mind. I&#8217;m just glad it&#8217;s not raining.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">This currently has a startlingly similar feel to the time when I was hitch hiking, maybe in townsville, where three lovely African girls took me to their families house where I helped cook and babysit the children and they fed me. Then they tried to bring me out to a party with them and told me that it was no problem and they&#8217;d sort somewhere out for me to crash the night. I said no. I said that a truck driver might pick me up over night and take me a long distance. Sometimes I need to be beaten until I&#8217;m unconscious and then when I wake up, beaten again just to drive the point home. That was a stupid decision and this one seems no better.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TaS_a0-NilM/T_wUHw4C0FI/AAAAAAAAEeQ/hzItLdv3bi0/s1600/IMG047.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TaS_a0-NilM/T_wUHw4C0FI/AAAAAAAAEeQ/hzItLdv3bi0/s320/IMG047.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If you squint, that&#8217;s Lee!!</td></tr></tbody></table>Anyway, turning down that lift lead to me meeting Lee. I&#8217;d just made it to the outskirts and had a lot of people driving past pointing. It was rather futile though because I hadn&#8217;t made it to the unknown intersection ahead, so I had no idea which way I&#8217;m going. Anyway, Lee was a French hitch hiker who was on my turf and was also heading to Carnarvon that night. He didn&#8217;t seem to have much luck and nor did I after meeting him. I stopped hitch hiking and walked a few km&#8217;s past him before sticking my thumb out again. Only to see him drive past in the longed for comfort of the passenger seat of some car. He didn&#8217;t even wave! And then… a few km&#8217;s further, we crossed paths again. I hadn&#8217;t managed to get a lift and apparently his fell quite a bit short. I should probably point out that Lee was doing the wise thing and waiting next to the 24hr service station. I walked past him again and got a phone call from Sammy at around sunset which I stopped short since a car was stopping for me.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HHX-hM4oWSI/T_wV1lvd60I/AAAAAAAAEeY/026-KdxTlGg/s1600/IMG048.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HHX-hM4oWSI/T_wV1lvd60I/AAAAAAAAEeY/026-KdxTlGg/s320/IMG048.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The family didn&#8217;t even see it!</td></tr></tbody></table>My next lift was a family that took me into Northampton. The girl, who was around my age, was telling me about how she&#8217;d briefly owed monkeys in Indonesia. They also explained that Northampton&#8217;s population of 1000 was enough to support three bars. Upper, middle and Lower. Or was it First, Second and Third? Meh. They were amazingly creative names. I had a beer in the last one. I was hoping for some food but the kitchen was closed. The girl behind the bar was a gorgeous Italian girl. We talked a bit about travelling and then instead of:</div><br /><ul><li>asking about accommodation,</li><li>hitting on her, or</li><li>getting ridiculously drunk, or</li></ul><br />or anything else that could have resulted in me not lying on the side of the road ridiculously aware of the fact I was freezing, I quietly walked off. Really just running towards my eventual fate. Right now, I&#8217;m using my computer as extra &#8216;heating&#8217;. I have another jumper. To find out why it&#8217;s wet instead of just a little dirty we&#8217;ll have to ask last evening&#8217;s hungover Bodey. I&#8217;m not his biggest fan. So, another night of walking because it&#8217;s too cold to sleep. Last time I was in this position I learnt that my hiking pack <strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong> effectively double as a sleeping bag. This time I learnt that maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have (deliberately!?) left my sleeping bag and tent at home. It&#8217;s not completely my fault I&#8217;m in this situation. The weather man lied to me about the night time temperature. It&#8217;s mostly my fault though.<br /><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Before I knew it was going to be this cold I made do by setting up a hovel in a grove using my backpack as the final wind break. I was sharing it with a number of rodents that wanted to continuously run through the grass. Off in the distance was the symphonic tune of multiple of dogs howling and barking which lead to me I drifting off to sleep with the soothing thoughts of wether foxes would take on a sleeping human (the dogs didn&#8217;t seem to be getting any closer). This didn&#8217;t last long because it was still cooling down around me.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">First I went through my pack, putting on the few clothes that were dirty instead of going into the washing machine the night before. This only briefly helped but then I hit the jackpot. I needed to eat and Sarah&#8217;s kit-kats were in my pocket wrapped in a bag. I grumpy tore them apart hoping that there was no note because it was unlikely to get read and that would get me in trouble. And then I saw it! Pop rocks! Holy shit. It was like heaven. True, a sleeping bag or those hand warmer things might of been more useful but far more mundane. Man now I want some more. Anyway, I had to abandon the hovel to walk to feel warm. A bit further along I decided jogging on the spot is a far better idea. I&#8217;m now aware that the last town&#8217;s caravan park was full so staying there wasn&#8217;t an option. It&#8217;s five thirty so I&#8217;ve almost made it through the long night. The next few hitch hiking legs are 400 km segments so this shouldn&#8217;t happen again. I&#8217;m still going to make sure my clothes are dry.</div></div>

Well, apparently wine tasting is a bit of a gimmick. Well, the paper &#8217;<a href="http://www.wine-economics.org/workingpapers/AAWE_WP16.pdf">Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better? Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings</a>&#8217; say&#8217;s something like that. This is more of a note for me to flick through it later and&#8230; I figure I might want to find this someday :P</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m56jar9gHE1qadtd1o1_400.jpg" style="float: left;" /><br/>When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don’t ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance… . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind… . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time… . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it’s much more meaningful… . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don’t think I’ll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful.</p><footer><strong>Ann Druyan</strong></footer></blockquote>

So, I&#8217;m planning on doing some travelling soon and I&#8217;ve started wondering how much language I should learn before I leave. And this got me thinking about the minimum phrases needed for communication. Really, this number is close to zero since arm waving and pictures can get you through, but it&#8217;s nice making things easier for other people.<br /><br />As far as I&#8217;m concerned, numbers are out. You make too many mistakes until you master them and there is a quite a bit of rote learning. There&#8217;s just too much risk of doing more harm than good by trying to use them. So, what is in? My current list is pretty short:<br /><br /><ul><li>Good</li><li>Please</li><li>Thank you</li><li>Beer</li><li>Cute / Pretty</li><li>Where</li><li>Help</li><li>Hospital</li></ul><div>Obviously there are a few more you might want to add depending on specifics. Like &#8220;train station&#8221; if you&#8217;re expecting to use a lot of public transport.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wonder what&#8217;s missing&#8230;</div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of embedded programming for Stellaris microcontrollers in C recently. I&#8217;ve needed various queue&#8217;s to buffer data between code running in different interrupt contexts and ended up using some hacked up sub optimal implementations that then got hacked away while trying to find a particularly annoying bug. After fixing the bug and coming back to clean up the code and merge, I found <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/vandooren/archive/2007/01/05/creating-a-thread-safe-producer-consumer-queue-in-c-without-using-locks.aspx">a nice blog</a> going over a lockless producer consumer queue. It&#8217;s reliant on at most one consumer thread and one producer thread. And neither of the reader access or writer access methods are reentrant. For my needs, there is more than one interrupt context that the producer can run from so interrupts have to be disabled in the code. Here is a mutilated version of the code. Due to a lack of locks, the size code should only be used as a rough measure. I was only using it for some debug while determining the best size for the queues.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Learning Korean]]></title>
    <link href="http://porcoesphino.github.io/2011/12/16/learning-korean/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-16T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://porcoesphino.github.io/2011/12/16/learning-korean</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
A while back now, I bought a book on learning Korean to impress my then girlfriend. We then broke up, before I read more than the prelude. Being stubborn, and now owning a book on Korean that would have no purpose otherwise, I decided to learn Korean. It turns out that the book wasn&#8217;t really useful for this. Fate hey. And the purpose of this blog post is to point out some things that have been been useful. I figure I may as well since I wrote most of this in an email to a friend so it&#8217;s mostly already written!! So, here goes. Wait, first, here&#8217;s <a href="http://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?query=%EB%A7%90">the only dictionary</a> I&#8217;ve found that&#8217;s reasonably usable and good for a non-Korean speaker.<br /><br />First things first. Learn the alphabet. There isn&#8217;t really any compromise here, especially since it&#8217;s so quick and simple. I find computer games are the fastest for this. Sadly they aren&#8217;t used often enough for knowledge acquisition. There isn&#8217;t a lot of choice in Korean,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeriagloris.com/learnkorean/">this game</a>&nbsp;is the only reasonable one I could find and it&#8217;s no&nbsp;<a href="http://lrnj.com/">Slime Forest Adventure</a>. Then, practice some pronunciation of these sounds using&nbsp;<a href="http://koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Learn_hangeul">this page</a>&nbsp;from the <a href="http://koreanwikiproject.com/">Korean Wiki Project</a>. It also has a <a href="http://koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Language_sites">nicely compiled list</a> of language learning sites.<br /><br />Now comes the real learning. There&#8217;s a few ways to go about this. My preference is to use <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> and build up my own cards. I know the data will be there for as long as I want it and I can code a port to a better system if one comes along. It allows you to remember facts over time using less and less effort as you become more familiar with these facts. The only problem then is to find the resource to learn from before you memorise using Anki.<br /><br />Ideally, lessons introduce well explained concepts quickly, without dumping too much on you. It would allow listening to plenty of audio, use natural language and use the Korean alphabet. It would throw in a bit of culture and explain common uses of some phrases. I had trouble finding something nice, but settled on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.talktomeinkorean.com/">Talk to me in Korean</a>. So far, I&#8217;ve liked it.<br /><br />I use three different models for study. One for numbers(/counters), one for general questions and one for example sentences. Ideally, a few cards would be put in for each &#8216;grammar point&#8217; with most of these cards using a sentence that only introduces one new word. Each of these sentences should have an explanation of the grammar point to ensure you knew it when you answered.<br /><br />At some point you have to start being more natural with your language use. You hear people arguing for immersive language study &#8216;because it works with children&#8217;. I think that view&#8217;s overly simplistic. Children get dumbed down info and frequently corrected. We don&#8217;t easily have that luxury as adults. The other view I&#8217;ve seen that was interesting is never make a mistake. If you don&#8217;t know how to say something, don&#8217;t say it. The argument here is that if the other person understands you, it will reinforce that you were correct, even if you weren&#8217;t and then you&#8217;ll get into the habit of using incorrect language. I can&#8217;t find the website that is based around this idea though &gt;&lt; That is a scary, slow and tedious path though although I think there is some truth in it. I&#8217;ve seen too many people that were speaking some great English more into a house filled with people learning English whereby everyone starts reinforcing each others bad use of English.&nbsp;It&#8217;s part of why I really don&#8217;t like the view of only speaking the native language of a country you move to.<br /><br />So then, how do you best go from book learning to something fluent, useful and fun? Who knows? :P From now though I&#8217;ve got a reasonable basis of knowledge with Korean and if I wait much longer I&#8217;ll probably start reinforcing bad grammar and pronunciation, so it&#8217;s time to work on it. My first step is to find some people who&#8217;s English is roughly&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;to my Korean and enforce a half hour solely of one language, followed by a half hour of the other. The other step is to start making diary posts at&nbsp;<a href="http://lang-8.com/">Lang-8</a>&nbsp;again. It&#8217;s a pretty cool site where you correct peoples diary posts that they&#8217;ve written in your language and other people correct yours. Multiple people make corrections and you get to see the result. I should probably start making some Japanese posts there again too. It&#8217;s been a while :P It might make up for me skipping the language exchange tonight :P<br /><br />To finish up, I thought I&#8217;d leave with a pretty cool video I watched today that ends with him talking about a beta for a new language learning site. I think it&#8217;s a great idea and very positive, but I&#8217;m not so sure it&#8217;s that good for the learner. I can&#8217;t see how the progression,&nbsp;reinforcement&nbsp;and non-overwhelmingness required for language learning fits smoothly, but hopefully that will be introduced into the idea with time. Oh, a last point before I put on the video. I learn concepts easily and visuals / tasks (writing Chinese characters) but I&#8217;m not so good with audio.. or learning new vocabulary. I really just grind it out. Anki is good for making sure you don&#8217;t forget, but it&#8217;s not designed for learning. That&#8217;s not a problem for using Anki to learn Kanji or grammar points, but it&#8217;s not perfect for me <b>learning</b>&nbsp;new vocabulary. Anyone got any pointers? I suppose that&#8217;s where immersion helps :P Anyway, here&#8217;s the video:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="374" width="526"> <param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf">   </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />   <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/>   <param name="wmode" value="transparent">   </param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff">   </param><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2011X/Blank/LuisVonAhn_2011X-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/LuisVonAhn_2011X-embed.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=1295&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration;year=2011;theme=the_rise_of_collaboration;event=TEDxCMU;tag=Technology;tag=collaboration;tag=computers;tag=internet;tag=language;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" />   <embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="526" height="374" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2011X/Blank/LuisVonAhn_2011X-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/LuisVonAhn_2011X-embed.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=1295&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration;year=2011;theme=the_rise_of_collaboration;event=TEDxCMU;tag=Technology;tag=collaboration;tag=computers;tag=internet;tag=language;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;"></embed> </object></div></div>

So, I&#8217;ve decided to start using this bad boy again. It should be a big of fun. It&#8217;s looking far sexier than last time I saw it. This is going to just be a quick post to some links really. I started Rogaining with some mates recently. A friend recently started dating a girl who is quite into it, and I&#8217;ve always wanted to give it a shot. Not wanting to take the easy route, I started with the 24 hour event. We won!! Well.. we won the category we were in. The &#8220;I&#8217;ve never done this before&#8221; category, if you must know. We came 19th or 20th all up. Anyway, I just found out that the results online and figured it couldn&#8217;t hurt to link them somewhere. For now, this is it. I may need to add some pics and find a better home though.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://wa.rogaine.asn.au/index.php/results/379-over-the-watershed-results">2011/06/20: Over the Watershed</a></li><li><a href="http://wa.rogaine.asn.au/index.php/results/391-dark-swamp-results">2011/10/16: dark-swamp-results</a></li></ul><div>Also of note:</div><div><ul><li>A supra is probably not the most functional car getting there.</li><li>Four ticks plus a huge one are uncool to have on you.</li></ul></div></div>

    <link href="http://porcoesphino.github.io/2010/01/21/geolocated-diary-a-travel-blog-review/"/>
    <updated>2010-01-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://porcoesphino.github.io/2010/01/21/geolocated-diary-a-travel-blog-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve decided to have a shot at a geo-located blog again. Ages ago I put together a hack job&nbsp;using yahoo tubes, google calendar and&nbsp;google mashup to kind of give you blog that you could navigate either by date or map. It didn&#8217;t work very well, wasn&#8217;t fun to put input data in, and I gave up fairly quick.&nbsp;Now google mashups doesn&#8217;t exist anymore (<a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-calendar-google-maps.html">although a similar app does in google apps</a>) and finding my old google sites made me think: It&#8217;s time; I&#8217;m going to find something that works. And so the hunt began.&nbsp;This time I&#8217;d also like it to be somehow compatible with google sites. At first it looked like a travel blog was the way to go. Sadly most of these didn&#8217;t give me the navigation elements, or control that I wanted. And in almost all, I&#8217;d loose the data if they found it offensive. Really what I&#8217;m hoping for is just a blog that can have structured data for your location and a few other things like the weather, then also a few gadgets for things like making it navigatable via topic, calendar and map. Wait, lets put this into a list. They&#8217;re always nicer to read:<br /><br /><ul><li>embedded map that:</li><ul><li>depends on posts</li><li>can be viewed like a trip</li><li>doesn&#8217;t get too cluttered</li><li>can be embedded in individual posts</li><li>being able to clip what is contained in the map could be nice</li><li>isn&#8217;t slow</li></ul><li>compatibility with mobile devices (ie. my android phone)</li><li>some other cool fields like weather</li><li>wow, that&#8217;s not a lot really&#8230;</li></ul><br />But guess what? Blogger is adding geotagging!! Now all I need to do is to make a cool gadget or find someone else&#8217;s. &nbsp;<a href="http://blurbbits.blogspot.com/">BlurbBits</a>&nbsp;seems like an early contender for taking information out of the blog, and parsing it into a navigation element. I think I&#8217;ll go with this approach for now and let you know how it goes later. In the mean time I&#8217;ll be reading a bit at <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">Google maps Mania</a>&nbsp;and reading through a few of <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/blogger/thread?tid=6b96ea66f7eccf2b&amp;hl=en">these ideas</a> from travel bloggers using Blogger.&nbsp;Since I&#8217;ve already done a bit of research into the travel blogs, I figure I may as well summarise what I&#8217;ve found too.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s a list of the ones I found (I&#8217;ll be editing this soon):<br /><br /><ul><li>TravelPod</li><li>Travelblog</li><li>Travellerspoint (really good for planning trips and getting info)</li><li>Travbuddy (seemed to have some promise)</li><li>Dopplr (had some cool maps build up of things people have liked, along with a mobile site)</li><li>Everlater</li><li>Bootsnall</li><li>Offexploring (hardly worth mentioning)</li></ul><div>I found a few different reviews. <a href="http://www.travelfish.org/feature/91">This one</a>&nbsp;gives a nice&nbsp;review of TravelPod, Travelblog and Travellerspoint &nbsp;but it&#8217;s over a year old and doesn&#8217;t seem very accurate when it talks about the maps but this seems common for these reviews. I think TravelPod just updated their mapping stuff, but then it would seem that Travellerspoint&#8217;s was also nerfed.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tourcms.com/blog/2009/01/09/creating-a-trip-blog-how-would-you-do-it-pitch-your-ideas/">This review</a> goes over a few ideas in general for a self hosted blog. If you go to <a href="http://www.izunotravel.com/trip-journals-ranking/">IzunoTravel</a>&nbsp;you&#8217;ll find a nice table summarising different travel blog features with a nice write up too.</div><div><br /></div><div>On a largely unrelated note, these&nbsp;<a href="http://www.designspongeonline.com/2009/08/made-with-love-found-terrariums.html">terrariums</a>&nbsp;are cool. I think I&#8217;ll make one.</div><br /><br /><br /></div>

Apparently MS Word doesn&#8217;t have an update all button for fields, which is frustrating. It also doesn&#8217;t have the developer tab added by default which is just as annoying. It can be found in a checkbox under general settings. Update all can be added in as a macro as summarised on <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm">this blog</a>. But in summary, the macro&#8217;s code is simply this:<br /><code><br />Sub UpdateAll()<br />Dim oStory As Range<br />For Each oStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges<br />oStory.Fields.Update<br />If oStory.StoryType &lt;&gt; wdMainTextStory Then<br />While Not (oStory.NextStoryRange Is Nothing)<br />Set oStory = oStory.NextStoryRange<br />oStory.Fields.Update<br />Wend<br />End If<br />Next oStory<br />Set oStory = Nothing<br />End Sub</code></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
So, in honour of Moet, I thought I&#8217;d quote a some which I&#8217;m sure he hates :P But, it has been a while since I wrote in this thing so  I figure its time for an update. Today&#8217;s story: Getting back home. If you&#8217;d call it home. I&#8217;m not really sure I have a place that feels like home anymore, although I am quite proud of the house I&#8217;m living in now, but then pride isn&#8217;t always a good thing. Odd fact, when I used to see that tower at uni after a short trip it would feel like I was coming home. I didn&#8217;t get that when I came back to Australia :&#8217;( So this blog is about getting from Japan to Australia. Now where to start??<br /><br />Hmm, so I&#8217;d moved out of my place and was staying at my mates place for a week before I left. Lots of stories there, but that&#8217;s a different entry. Who the hell decides to explore the sewers when it&#8217;s raining and cold just for the hell of it? Well, me, but what kind of moron would follow me?? So anyway, I kept postponing leaving because, well, because I didn&#8217;t want to leave. Funny that. But eventually I couldn&#8217;t postpone it, got my stuff together, that being a cardboard box and my bag, and walked to the nearest convenience store to get a marker and make my sign for hitch hiking to Tokyo. It&#8217;s sitting next to me right now actually :) The girls at the store loved it, well at least that&#8217;s what I took their laughing to mean :P My first couple of lifts took me a short distances around Nagoya. First lift was two girls who were&#8230; nope I can&#8217;t remember any of the details. They had a story though. The next was a girl who worked in a company because she could speak English but then never got the opportunity to speak it. Then, I spent half a day waiting next to the toll way on ramp before I gave up and started walking for a few hours. Eventually a Japanese guy who had hitch hiked all through Europe gave me a lift to a store in the toll way. There I met an Aussie guy who convinced his wife to give me a lift. They were just on holidays to meet her family, and on the way her sister seemed to go into shock, we almost got pulled over by the cops and they fed me a whole heap. Just before I got out the car to meet Snave I palmed some money into his hand because I knew the wife wouldn&#8217;t approve. Crazy cultural differences :P<br /><br />Hmm, that paragraph was a bit long. I&#8217;ll see what I can do about that. So, I was in Tokyo? Yeah, Tokyo and meeting Snave. So, I met him, borrowed some money to pay a debt, went out for a drink and caught a plane to Australia.<br /><br />See, that was an improvement ;) When I was booking my ticket my only requirement was that it went from Japan, to Australia. I thought I&#8217;d bought a ticket from Tokyo to the Gold Coast. I was wrong. On a side note, the Japanese staff loved my pants and hair (Even the male flight attendant wanted to touch it&#8230; wait on!), the Australian staff were rude and snide-ish. Oh yeah, and I only had $30 to get to Melbourne to meet my friend and depending on how that went hitch along the Nullarbor or beg for money. I spent most of my time in the airport cheating their hotel finder to display maps from Cairns to Melbourne and take pictures of them with my phone. Oh yeah, I was in the Gold Coast. Then I chatted to some Japanese girls I&#8217;d met on the plane and quickly ascertained that I couldn&#8217;t go to any of the interesting places with my $30, so I left.<br /><br />So, umm, people picked me up and drove me? Who? This is what happens when you wait so long to write. Wait, one guy worked in the mines for half a year, saved, quite his job to sit on his arse and drink and then would start again. Not a bad life. There was an old bloke with kids my age. Then a guy who took me a decent distance and we kept stopping at water holes to go for walks and shit. It would of worked better if I&#8217;d had more sleep. He dropped me off near Townsville I think. I had a cat nap till go cold and started walking. The next guy was a champ and gave me a beer. Happiest moment of my life was sitting on that street verge drinking that beer. Then, after getting abused for bogans who mistook me for &#8216;some cunt who should go the fuck home&#8217;, wait that could be me, I was picked up by three African girls who took me back to their parents house where they told them I was a friend from uni and I helped cook and entertain the kids. They also offered for me to got to a party with them and then give me a place to crash. I hadn&#8217;t had a shower for a few days and wanted to try to get a lift with a trucky so I said no. I slept on the side of the high way with no blanket or tent freezing for a few hours. Then I walked until I was too tired to walk and then tried to sleep again. Rinse and repeat. I probably could of played those cards better..<br /><br />In the morning, after waking up behind the bridge I was using to hide, I got picked up by some fishermen. They didn&#8217;t say too much. Next was the army guy who wanted to know if I was an emo because then &#8220;I should get the fuck out of his car&#8221;. He was going to be going all the way to Brisbane but stopped halfway, probably because I was too emo for his standards. Then near some place, the single mum picked me up said I had a face that looked trustworthy and took me back to her place after her parents had left. Sometimes I feel like screaming at people &#8220;So does a serial killer!!&#8221;. Still, I got a meal cooked for me, a place to sleep, a shower and got to hang with a pretty cool girl and her kid.<br /><br />The next morning she dropped me off near the supermarket where I picked up some supplies and kept on trucking. Speaking of which, there was a cool bus there that reminded me of the one we used to live in. I think the next lift was the wife who was scared of what the husband would think, but then drove me and tried to get me a lift with some truckies. It failed but I did get my final lift of the trip.<br /><br />So I was standing there with my thumb out and this guy stops and reverses. I quickly say goodbye to the lady and run up to the car and jump in. The guy who was giving me the lift wasn&#8217;t saying that much, but was going all the way to Brisbane so along we go. I started with some small talk.<br /><br />&#8220;So, what do you do?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Do you want the truth?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Why not?&#8221;<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m a debt collector&#8221;<br />&#8220;Nice, so how&#8217;s that go for you?&#8221;<br />&#8220;I walk in and take shit&#8221;<br />&#8220;Ah, many problems with the cops?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Nah, mostly its me that calls them.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Shit hey&#8221;<br /><br />It turned out to be quite an eventful drive. He confided in me about his original intent of reversing up close to me then taking off and spraying me in rocks. Great! And then asked if I minded if he stopped for a bong break. I told him it was his car and he could do what ever the hell he liked. So, he has his bong, takes a pill and keeps driving. By this stage the small talk had run out and my sleep deprived body was having trouble staying awake. He simple hunched himself over the steering wheel and kept driving. He stopped a few more times for these breaks, one time scaring the hell out of a school bus full of kids, before he couldn&#8217;t find his pills. He asked me to look for them. I did. It was probably time to find out what they were.<br /><br />&#8220;So, what are these pills&#8221;<br />&#8220;Well, I probably should have told you before. I&#8217;m Schizophrenic.&#8221;<br /><br />Joy!! Well, it did explain a few things. And I did make it to Brisbane alive and in one piece. I hope he went alright in making it to see his girlfriend #3 and cleaning up his property. Hmm&#8230; I did miss that part of the story, ah well.<br /><br />So he left me at a truck stop. I was starting to question the route I&#8217;d taken. Maybe I should double check if my Aussie bank account had any money in it. Now where to find a Bankwest on the east coast. I was told there was one and it only took me two hours of solid walking to find it. I got out $100 and had a second wind. I could do this. Quitting&#8217;s for&#8230; quiters? So I stood near the freeway on ramp, thumb out, hopes held &nbsp;high and&#8230; feinted. I still haven&#8217;t found out why, but I&#8217;m guessing it was my diet of bread and little sleep. Still it had only been three days. I curled up around the corner and tried to get some sleep. When I woke up I decided it was time to call it a day, I needed a friend to buy my plane ticket home. And someone did. Well, to Melbourne where I hung out with Ra for a week and borrowed money off her for the plane ticket home.<br /><br />About a week later I managed to sneak into my parents house in Balingup unannounced and scare the hell out of them. That was when they found out I was home. What did they do to deserve me as a son.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#8217;s good to be back and to be seeing friends I&#8217;d been missing. Now I&#8217;ve just got to knuckle under, get rid of this last year of uni and pay off some debts.</div>

It feels like it&#8217;s time for another walk. I want to go to Okinawa but I&#8217;m not sure I have the money so I&#8217;m thinking I will start hitch hiking and see how far I get. I don&#8217;t want to start in a city so I&#8217;m thinking about starting from Gifu or maybe Nara again. We&#8217;ll see. I should be heading off Saturday after Capoeira.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I went to a theme park today, well not really since I&#8217;m writing this retrospectively but just look at the date it <span style="font-weight: bold;">says</span> it was written and pretend.<br /><br />So, it was <span style="font-weight: bold;">awesome</span>! It was my first time. It was for Rie&#8217;s birthday, we had said we were going to go for a while and she said she really liked this place. So, on my first big roller coaster I almost shat myself, but it didn&#8217;t stop me admiring how flat and artificial the reclaimed land looked whenever we went over a crest. Oh, and there were people on the some mud flats way off in the distance doing something, and I never worked out what. I asked Rie but she had her head in her hands for the whole rollercoaster ride, so she didn&#8217;t know what I was talking about. I don&#8217;t know how &#8216;fun&#8217; and &#8216;head in hands&#8217; are meant to be the same thing but hey.<br /><br />What else happened&#8230; oh yeah&#8230; the water park. That was a laugh. There was a slide where your falling vertically for a few metres, plus the tapering bits, and I was ok when I layed down but as soon as I hit that verticle bit my hands went out to grab the slide and stop me falling. It did nothing!! After a second I told my self I was a dick and enjoyed the rest of the ride. Ah, it was great.<br /><br />Ooh, there was this circle pool with a strong current that pushed you around. The current was the strongest next to a set of stairs, so you&#8217;ld let the current pull you round and then try to grab on to the ledge and pull yourself around. It was strong enough that you needed, nay I needed, most of my strength to pull myself in. Suffice it to say, I took out a few toddlers along the way, but I made it in.<br /><br />And they had one of those artificial beaches with artificial waves, but&#8230; me and Rie got there just as they were finishing. So we stuffed around trying to lift each other up and throw each other, but not before I tried to see as much of the wave making mechanism as I could&#8230; but it wasn&#8217;t doing anything and I couldn&#8217;t work it out :( I would have to just be a moving wall, right? And the force needed to move that would have to be pretty large, right? Just playing there with Rie was the best part of the day.<br /><br />Hmm&#8230; what else was there&#8230; ooh the thing that just dropped you, and the thing that threw you up into the air like a space shuttle, and the roller coaster with the loop-de-loop, and the roller coaster with the loop-de-loop that didn&#8217;t start by taking you to the top of a hill, it actually started buy unsuspectingly slingshoting you and scaring the shit out of you at the same time. I think thats enough of a sentence for now.<br /><br />So, I was pretty tired since the night before I had played futsal I met a bloke who offered to take me out for dinner, maybe for a bit of English practice. He had lived in America for a while and wanted to be a writer but for now was working in the family business which was good for him since he travelled to see clients a lot which was writing and reading time for him. We ate at this thing where you fry meat on this BBQ infront of you and eat it. おいしいだよ！ One of the things that we ate was raw minced meat, with a raw egg with a slice of apple on top. It didn&#8217;t taste too bad. I had to wonder how disease ridden it was. Anyway, due to this late night out I passed out in the car ride home, but woke up well enough to entertain Rie before she went home.<br /><br />I think thats all&#8230; The End?</div>

I went to my local スーパー (supermarket) today and saw a fish still flicking. I thought this was odd since my ex-housemate HayHay told me that the-fish-on-ice thing is just a mockery since fish are frozen on the boat. I believed you HayHay!! :&#8217;( So I took this movie since I thought &#8216;WTF!&#8217;. Since then I&#8217;ve notice that they have fish in an aquarium that they must kill them on the spot&#8230; opps.

Ouch. I don&#8217;t know how much sleep I&#8217;d had when I wrote this, but it was pretty horrible. Anyway, I think this is the time I was wandering around my local supermarket and I bumped into someone behind me and swiftly said sorry in Japanese. I was pretty proud because up until then I had to think about things like that. Sadly.. it was a foreigner and I&#8217;m not sure they spoke Japanese. This seemed to break my swing, because I later stumbled into a poor Japanese girl (yeah, I hadn&#8217;t had a lot of sleep) and said sorry in English. The small victories, hey? Anyway, back to the original:<br /><br />This actually happened pretty quick. It was about two weeks before &#8220;はい&#8221; became reactionary. I was trying to sort out some bank things with my bank in Australia (and that was an effort) and ended up saying はい to the BankWest girl on the phone. Then wondering if she understood, which was quickly followed by &#8216;what is she thinking? Does she just think I&#8217;m some &#8216;tard!? Wait she&#8217;s moving on! Dammit &gt;&lt; I stopped listening. Whats she saying now? Ooh.. she wants me to say something..&#8221; and if that fiction is anything like what actually happened then that could explain why that bank transfer went astry stranding me in おおさか but then, me not knowing how acurate it is would also explain the problems&#8230;</div>
