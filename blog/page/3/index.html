<a href="http://www.drhorrible.com/">http://www.drhorrible.com/</a><br /><br />Anyone else watching this? It makes me wish for a second season of Firefly again. Never going to happen though :(<br /><br />It also kinda reminds me of a review I was told about for Ash&#8217;s song &#8220;Girl from Mars&#8221; where they said it was by far the greatest song about a girl from mars ever written and could only be surpassed if someone bothered to write another. I can&#8217;t seem to find a reference to this on the internet so maybe it&#8217;s just hearsay..  I heard if from HayHay&#8230; so..<br /><br />Anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Horrible%27s_Sing-Along_Blog" title="Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog">Dr. Horrible&#8217;s Sing-Along Blog</a> (Wikipedia article) is by far the best supervillian comedy musical that I&#8217;ve ever seen.<br /><br />So here&#8217;s a quote. It doesn&#8217;t give the &#8220;movie&#8221; justice, but my favourite quote gives some of the story away :(<br /><b></b><b></b><blockquote><b>Billy:</b> I want to be an achiever&#8230; like Bad Horse.<br /><b>Penny:</b> The Thoroughbred of Sin?<br /><b>Billy:</b> I meant Gandhi.</blockquote>Well&#8230; it over now :( But here&#8217;s the trailer&#8230;.<br /><br /><object width="400" height="225">    <param name="allowfullscreen" value="true">    <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always">    <param name="movie" value="http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1227202&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1">    <embed src="http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1227202&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="225"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1227202?pg=embed&amp;sec=1227202">Teaser</a> from <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/drhorrible?pg=embed&amp;sec=1227202">Dr. Horrible&#039;s Sing-Along Blog</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&amp;sec=1227202">Vimeo</a>.</div>

I chose the title to reflect my being a English teacher now. I think I should also try to palm off the last sentence as&#8230; so&#8230; I just ate marked down watermelon from the 99円 (~$1AUD) store. It was awesome even if it was shriveled and marked down. But the whole point of going to the store where I ended up buying the über cool watermelon was to get supplies for the war on fruit flies. Those of you that knew good old 57 Leura st. would know of the war on cockroaches.. we won the odd battle but we definitely lost the war. Well, over here I&#8217;m losing my battle against the fruit fries and the cockroaches are their new found allies. It turns out that not cleaning your house for over a week during summer and leaving the food stacked on your super small table is actually bad. On a sperate note, its hot over here. And not just a little hot. Where talking&nbsp;thermos hot.&nbsp;Well thats not really true, its pretty hot and incredibly humid. We&#8217;re talking up to 30℃ with up to 80% humidity, presumably not at the same time, but I couldn&#8217;t get pretty graph in my quick google search, just those two numbers&#8230; Oh yeah, so I have an über cool airconditioner. Well it might be über cool, I&#8217;m not really sure since I cant find the remote. Presumably it was here when I moved in and I&#8217;ve lost it&#8230; but you never can be too sure. What else did the title talk about? Oh yeah, it was shopping and shoes. There are lots of sales on at the moment and I still don&#8217;t have too many clothes so I thought I would check them out. Shopping is <span style="font-weight: bold;">HARD</span>. Everything I found something that I liked, it was expensive and it took <span style="font-weight: bold;">so</span> long to find things I like :( I saw this awsome Gumby shirt and in the shirt Gumby was wearing an awesome shirt, but it was like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=88,000+JPY+in+AUD">88,000円</a>&#8230; hmm&#8230; maybe that is one too many zeros, still it was expensive. I also found a cool shirt with these gangster chickens, but I&#8217;m not so sure its worth me spending my hard earned 円 on a shirt just because there are gangster chickens on it. Oh, but I did find some cool shoes. I found these ones that are just like socks but with a sole, they&#8217;re <span style="font-weight: bold;">AWESOME</span>! Apparently there made for water sports or something but I&#8217;m just going to wear them everywhere. I&#8217;m also falling inlove with the shoes that look like shoes when your wearing pants but really are just slippers. I&#8217;ve found out that you can go jogging in them, so maybe I will just wear them everywhere instead. Well, that was probably a boring post but I thought I should write something.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll leave splitting the post into well structured paragraphs as an exercise for my readers&#8230;</div>

I just came back from a trip to Kyoto. It was pretty awesome. I got to eat tofu ice-cream, cheese cake crepe, jelly Fanta and&#8230; well I&#8217;m sure there was more. Hmm, fermented soybeans, but I eat them for breakfast everyday so they don&#8217;t count. Oh, I also had octopus and seaweed salad. Thats one of my favourites.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Soo, where was I? I don&#8217;t really know. Alicia from Perth is in Japan so I was traveling with her. There was a problem meeting up with her, so my morning was spent trying to call her while walking around 名古屋 (Nagoya) train station. That lasted four or so hours. I was proud of my endurance. In the end she got her phone working and we met at mine. We had a feast, it was awesome.</div><div><br /></div><div>So anyway, we got to Kyoto around ten P.M. on Saturday night and found a nice little hotel. We wandered around that night and the next morning and got some good shots (that I still can&#8217;t upload). I&#8217;ll put them up when I can and make some comments about them. I left for home eight P.M. Sunday night so I paid ~$100AUD in transport for less then 24 hours. Still I had a great time :)</div></div>

Now that its all over, I&#8217;ve got some money, my health is good and I&#8217;m starting to head out more, I figure its time to tell you guys how shitty things were for a while. I would have told you guys what was happening sooner, but there really wasn&#8217;t anything you could have done and all you would have done is worry and that is a shitty reason to tell a story :)<br /><div><br /></div><div>So.. it started a while back. Hmm.. where to start? After my walk seems like a good time to start.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had bugger all money. I think it was around $300 and was couch surfing at a families house. Well, sleeping in a closet while a rabbit was eating my clothes is a nice emotive description for this story. The wife had just brought home a Black painter friend (Annotation: All these guys are great friends now and have helped me out a huge amount.) over who kept talking about how easy it is to get a job here. I said I was having trouble getting a job here and next thing I knew I was on the phone and had an interview the next day. The night before I had sent an email to Aust. concerning work. So, by the day after the interview I had work in Japan and Australia. The Japanese job would give me a house and health insurance, with the only problem being that my first pay would be in just under two months. For my Perth work I was getting paid on completion so I borrowed some money from my lovely mother and got to work. I was going to be set, I would have money and somewhere to live, study + train. Just somewhere stable after no money and being homeless.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had been staying with the family a few days and though my house would be a few days away&#8230; turns out it was a few weeks away. This pretty quickly became an unspoken problem so I tried to give them as much space as I could in at their house and spent most of my time elsewhere, which is pretty much the worst thing I could have done. Pretty quickly it started to get to me. I was invading this lovely families space but had no money to go elsewhere and couldn&#8217;t think of any alternatives. They hadn&#8217;t said anything but I knew it was a problem. It was also starting to get to me that I had no space to myself or to spend with my girlfriend. I kept thinking that the next day I would have a house and everything would be okay, then I would talk to my company and there would be a problem. For some reason getting up at five A.M. and going to sleep at one P.M. while doing bugger all but sleeping started getting me down. I ended up spending the time that I wasn&#8217;t working sitting on park benches listening to music feeling awesome about myself, pretty emo :) My girlfriend lived pretty far away and neither of us had much money so we didn&#8217;t see each other too much.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally I got a house. Thank god. I had some space to myself, I finally had somewhere to just hangout and I forgot all about organising health insurance, the house was hard enough. I still had bugger all money but that didn&#8217;t bother me at this stage. I worked out a budget and blew the rest cheap useful things like washing powder and a toilet brush.</div><div><br /></div><div>The budget went well for a while. I had my bag of rice, natto and the odd curry. I had a cash job once a week that paid of my weekly expensive Japanese transport. I didn&#8217;t really have the money to head into the city to see Rie, but she would come over once or twice a week and feed me. It was awesome.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, well fate has a bitch of a sense of humour. I almost made it to payday, well it felt like I almost made it. Then fate decided to be a petting little bitch, one off my teeth died and I ended up with a jaw infection. One day I had a slightly sore tooth, five days later I had a jaw like captain hero and couldn&#8217;t sleep. I booked an appointment with the dentist for the weekend. By then things were pretty bad. The painkillers weren&#8217;t working so well so I just spent my time immersing myself in computer games. Sex kinda worked but it turns out that I clench my teeth and the pain can back in full force in the exhaustion that follows :( When I wasn&#8217;t having sex (or just after) and there wasn&#8217;t a computer handy then I looked like some ADD kid jumping from one thing to the next. It made for a pretty shit visit for Rie, for a good portion of the time we were at the dentist she sat in the corner being ignored while I ran around touching things.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>When the dentist finally saw me did he pick up a drill, put a hole in my tooth to remove some of the pressure? No, instead he put me on antibiotics and painkillers. Now that could of been cool, except when I got him to point to the drug in the painkiller (I had written codein, panadol, and ibuprofen in japanese on a sheet of paper) he told me that his painkiller was better. After some googling I found out that it was standard strength Panadol. I was pissed. I think so was Rie since she paid for most of the medicine and appointment. I don&#8217;t think she expected that. I had wanted to just drop my TV off as collateral or grab the goods and run, but Rie wasn&#8217;t so keen on that idea :(</div><div><br /></div><div>That night was an absolute bitch. I think I woke up for a few groaning sessions, it was great. By the next day the antibiotics seemed to have started their shizzle and my jaw didn&#8217;t hurt so much. A few days before this point I had arranged to borrow some money from a friend of mine in Australia (Your awesome Stef :)) &lt;- A double chinned smiley face :) ). I told Rie about this and that health insurance was finally getting sorted. I told her a day when both should be done and booked a dental appointment. Unbeknownst to me their was a problem with the money transfer.</div><div><br /></div><div>The night that I was meant to have everything sorted I got a message from Rie saying she was tired and would talk to me the next day. I now know that it was during her four hour break at work for night shift. She tried to get some sleep, I thought something was wrong, and soon enough she was talking about how we would make better friends. I figured it wasn&#8217;t the time to tell her that my tooth, money and health insurance were still screwed.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the next few days I tried to take up a friends offer to use his health insurance. That would come with the benefit of not having any medical costs. I&#8217;m kind of happy that didn&#8217;t work out. I didn&#8217;t really like the idea of screwing the population out of money I should be able to pay.. just not now. So, all trying to use his health insurance accomplished was to leave me stranded half way to his place Thursday night after work. We were going to fix my tooth and then I was going to do some work for him and he was going to give me transport money. I needed that money. I had ~$3AUD in my wallet and needed ~$10AUD to make it through the next day to my cash job. It wasn&#8217;t much of a discrepancy, but it was enough. With everything else it was enough to just stun me. I stayed outside the train station for about two hours going through my options. When I got there I had called all my Japanese contacts that were close enough to lend me some money. They were all busy&#8230; so I pretty much paced. I kept thinking about how there was no way I could get money from Australia to here for the following morning and just how alone I was. I felt like shit. There aren&#8217;t many times I have ever felt that bad. Reading through this now, it doesn&#8217;t seem like things were that bad but they felt like it.</div><div><br /></div><div>My solution in the end was to walk home and hit up every vending machine I found for change. Previously I had gotten ~$25AUD from a vending machine so I was in high hopes. I got about five cents&#8230; it was awesome. There are SO many vending machines.. and I had got no money. Luckily I had borrowed a bike so I thought I might be able to ride that into work the next morning. My morale was pretty low though. The walk was a bitch, I actually jumped on a train half way, five hours after work finished. I really didn&#8217;t think riding the bike the next morning was a viable option. Still I had no choice so I set my alarm for four am and hit the sack. Looking at it now its &lt;20km&gt;</div><div><br /></div><div>I got more money from a cash job that weekend, and wore my hair out to an art show. It was awesome. Then on the Monday I got my health insurance and money. God I needed it. A few days before I looked in the mirror and even I thought I looked gaunt. I actually weighed myself after the kyoto trip. I weight 59.5 (not wearing clothes) thats a few weeks after I got money and I think I&#8217;ve put on weight so god knows what it was before.

So, I&#8217;m writing this after a bit of a misunderstanding with one of my coworkers. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been paid to sit in a desk for eight hours today while someone was unimpressed with me so I wasn&#8217;t in a good mood. And I thought a bit.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I began to think about how little I want to go back to Perth. I&#8217;m not saying that I want to stay here or that Japan/(Japanese people) are better or anything stupid like that. What I am saying is that when I go back I expect I will hate a lot of the conversations I have when I get back. I think a lot of people are going to ask a lot of stupid badly thought out questions like:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that some Japanese writing can be read lots of different ways. That must be really hard.&#8221;</li></ul>At this point I can only hope that there is a Japanese/Kanji/Linguistics/Psychology/(Computer Science) textbook handy to beat them over the head with until they physically can&#8217;t ask any more questions. On a related note, I&#8217;m surprised by the number of Japanese people that tell me that lots of Kanji don&#8217;t have a meaning. Luckily I can just pretend that its a translation error and they mean that lots of Kanji don&#8217;t form a word on their own, or that simply because they have mostly learnt Kanji intuitively from words it is difficult to notice the common concept a given Kanji holds. Or I could be wrong and lots of Kanji really don&#8217;t map to one rough concept. I hope not because its a pretty refreshing idea for me. Actually, I think that translational difficulties are one of the reasons me an Rie stayed together as long as we did. It was a convenient excuse to have more tolerance and work on problems.. sometimes :P<br /><ul><li>&#8220;Japanese people are really quiet and polite, you can be pretty loud, how was that for you?&#8221;</li></ul><div>To this I just want to beat them over the head saying &#8220;people are people, get the fuck over the Japan thing&#8221;. Can you tell I&#8217;ve spent some time with some expats who I don&#8217;t understand why they haven&#8217;t gone home&#8230; wait I have heard. Money or something.. I really don&#8217;t understand. My god I tried hard to avoid expats so that this didn&#8217;t happen. I didn&#8217;t come to Japan to hang out with a whities, much less whities who bitch about yellowies. </div><div><br /></div><div>Hmm.. I think thats it. I guess I just needed to vent a little.</div></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So, a few people have been asking why me and Rie broke up. Its kind of a long boring story really, but here goes for those of you that want to hear it.<div><br /></div><div>In Australia, I was the one who helped her and, well, I was the man :P In Japan that was always going to change and I knew that would be a problem. Actually, that and the fact that she would be going back to her Japanese life and friends made me think that we would be breaking up very quickly after I got here. We never really talked about this and well, she never brought it up over the break up, I&#8217;m just starting from the beginning :)</div><div><br /></div><div>So, a few weeks ago Rie started a new job, a few less weeks ago she began working nights. New Job = new friends + change = thinking. Nights = not much time for us to see each other and being grumpy when we do see each other. Also, she was about to start training for her career. So, thats more change, thinking and less time. And then she had a job offer on the other side of the country. So the same deal except even MORE thinking.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, I had no money and kept asking her to help me with mundane things like phones etc. This meant that most of the free time we did have together was spent sorting out mundane things, or with one of us sleeping. On top of that, I didn&#8217;t have enough money to catch the subway to see her and she would always have to come and see me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, she was doing a lot of thinking about the future and apparently we are better off as friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hmm.. so when we broke up I asked her if she just wanted a break since all the reasons she was giving me sounded like &#8216;need space&#8217; not &#8216;the feelings not there&#8217;. But she was very clear she wanted to break up. Last week we went from broken up to on some sort of break, not much of a change really but maybe its something to write home about.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thats a pretty crummy explanation, but there you have it :)</div></div>

Only now, isolated and unable to communicate with the people around me can I begin to understand why Rie felt Moet was a kind giving person (I love ya&#8217; man, but you know&#8230; they&#8217;re not the usual adjectives that come to mind)&#8230;<br /><div><br /></div><div>Here I have trouble telling the crazies from the normies. Even when they are talking to themselves I wonder if they are just holding a supertinybutcute Japanese phone or just practicing for the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game">LARPER</a> session.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The date of this post is about when I started walking but the idea really started off a few days before in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya">Nagoya</a>. I had not yet done much travelling of Japan and was about to start a contract job for a webpage. I really didn&#8217;t want to settle down yet so I decided I should travel before starting work. The only problem&#8230; I only had about ¥20,000 which is roughly $200AUD or currently:<br /><div><br /></div><div><br /><br /><iframe height="150" src="http://finance.google.com/finance/converter?a=20000&amp;from=JPY&amp;to=AUD" width="400"></iframe><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>By the time I&#8217;d left Nagoya I had far closer to ¥14,000. I got to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara">Nara</a> late at night wondering if I would get to the Youth Hostel before curfew and if they would give me a room. Luckily they did and I soon ended up naked in the bath and chatting casually about where we came from and the decisions in our lives that led us here.</div><div><br /></div><div>The next day was spent looking through Nara&#8217;s amazing temples (so long as I didn&#8217;t have to pay) and meeting some cool guys. That not the topic of this post though so I&#8217;ll put that somewhere else. That night I worked out where I wanted to go.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now I hadn&#8217;t been to any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onsen">onsen</a> yet and a little south there was a place with three different onsen that the guide book said were the best in this area. That kinda sold me. So I did a few measurements with my fingers and figured I had to walk about 30km. I know that I walked 40km one night and my brothers walked from Bridgetown to Manji one day and thats 30kms. I was carrying a big bag so that might make it two days&#8230; thats one night sleeping on the side of the road which shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. So I talked to the new guy behind the counter and took some photos of his map before heading of to bed to get a good nights sleep.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now believe it or not (I choose not to) fingers are not the best measuring devices&#8230; On top of that Lonely planet guidebooks maps are really inaccurate and I was looking across two maps that had different scales and didn&#8217;t match so well. Finally I was walking through mountains and not as the crow flys.</div><div><br /></div><div>So on my first day my goal rapidly became: &#8220;Just make it south, it doesn&#8217;t matter where&#8221;. By the time it became dusk my goal became: &#8220;Just keep moving somewhere and don&#8217;t die&#8221;. By the time I set up camp under a bridge the goal had simplified to &#8220;Don&#8217;t Die&#8221;. Its simple I like it. Anyway&#8230; it was at about this point that I was reintroduced to how much colder it is over here. At first the concrete was just a little cold so I put on both jumpers and curled up over my hiking pack. This obviously wasn&#8217;t too comfortable but I made do and got about half hours kip. Then I put on more pants and shirts and took out the uncomfortable stuff from my pack and tried again. Then I moved up to the tiny slot that was smaller then the capsules at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_hotel">capsule hotel</a> (actually it was about the right size for what I would want to pay for) and once again tried to sleep. Finally I resorted to using my pack as a sleeping bag. Turns out I&#8217;m small but not that small. It was at this point that I hit gold. Walk during the night and sleep during the day.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Some Highlights of my 4 day hike (Others hidden in the map):<br /><ul><br /><li>Meeting many police officers who wanted to know wtf I was doing and wouldn&#8217;t let me sleep. Once I whipped out my laptop and double clicked on my last way point, the eyecandy seemed to convince them that I was well organised enough. I did lie to each of them about owning a tent and a sleeping bag though. And before the eye candy they would want me to keep walking and I would not have slept the night before and be staggering with a massive gapping drop that some might call a gorge off to one side..</li><br /><li>Being amazing surprised at how little water I had drunk over the last two days and how great I felt only to hardly be able to move the next evening when I woke up and got out of my drain. See, by this stage I had learnt that hiding from the friendly police was the best policy to avoid the sleeplessness they could cause and hence avoid stumbling half awake and falling to a rather adrenaline pumping death. Anyway, turns out I need to drink the same amount of water.</li><br /><li>That the smallest country towns actually do have about eight vending machines so that when you wake up and can hardly move due to your dehydration you just walk on for a few km&#8217;s and hit up the nearest vending machine.</li><br /><li>Seeing some amazing scenery. Will upload pics soon.</li><br /><li>People in country towns actually saying hello in the streets, smiling and giving me food.</li><br /><li>Finally making it, asking for directions only to have the old block walk 3kms to ask the local Baker who asked his customer who asked their Mums friend. Next thing you know I have a tour guide who paid for food and entry. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough they gave me a lift to the next town (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabe%2C_Wakayama">Tanabe</a>).</li></ul><br />My rough path is below. Turns out that its actually about 100km as the crow flys, google keeps telling me that there are no buses there so it wont tell me the real distance :( Will update soon.<br /><br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="350" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=110918555514755309463.00044d13b323115dc1ee3&amp;ll=34.218204,135.772694&amp;spn=0.090492,0.061687&amp;t=h&amp;output=embed&amp;s=AARTsJp1q-x9ZkeLHrRhrd4wq0ht0vcqcg" width="425"></iframe><br /><small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=110918555514755309463.00044d13b323115dc1ee3&amp;ll=34.218204,135.772694&amp;spn=0.090492,0.061687&amp;t=h&amp;source=embed" style="color: blue; text-align: left;">View Larger Map</a></small></div></div>

<br />I find that Latex slideshows actually look good, unlike there powerpoint cousins which often just look tacky. Unfortunately it can take a little more time putting together a latex slideshow. It seems the best bet is Keynote, but I&#8217;m a poor student! So here are a few notes for myself about using latex for slideshows.<br /><br />To use the CS Beamer package you will need the sty and lyx files <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/internal_pages/csse_forms?f=157893" mce_href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/internal_pages/csse_forms?f=157893">from here</a>.<br /><br /></div>
