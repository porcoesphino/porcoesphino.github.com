## Hey. I'm a software engineer and teacher currently living in Seoul, Korea. This is my personal website and blog.

<br/>

## Some things about me:
* Previously a Software Engineer at <a href="http://cybertechuav.com.au/">Cyber Technology</a> (Perth, Australia)
* Studied Computer Science (hons) and Mechatronics Engineering (hons) at <abbr title="the University of Western Australia">UWA</abbr>
* Lived in Japan for a year.
* Lived in a bus for a year instead of doing year nine. (Probably the same as second year middle school.)

I love <a href="/projects">building new things</a> and <a href="/projects">learning how things things work</a>. <!-- What is my strength -->
