So, I've been thinking more and more about how I'm progressing with my Korean. I'm happy with it (although it is a fair bit of work. Once I'm up to date with TTMIK I want to look at my work flow) but I'm shocked at what I can and can't say. Well no. I'm not shocked, it's always a bit amusing when you come across a hole that you have trouble communicating across. Sometimes it's the most basic things. For me, I've been following a course and largely following grammar rules. That means I really am stuck for early basic things in a conversation. I can say 'hi' but 'how are you?' is not something I know. Or it's more natural&nbsp;equivalent. I'll be &nbsp;starting to fix the more in a month but it is interesting how material is presented to you. If I were to do things again, I think I'd go through something concurrently with TTMIK. The TTMIK guys have a really nice repour, teach well and are fun. But it doesn't present material in an order I'd like. Great if you're doing they're lessons as they come out and doing other work around them but not so great if you're solely concentrating on them. Still... I'm stubborn. Another month and I'll be up to date with TTMIK and then I'll put more effort into these weaknesses. Two course I did recently see that had good content progression I thought where:<br /><br />- Making out in Korean<br />-&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://fsi-language-courses.org/Courses/Korean/" href="http://fsi-language-courses.org/Courses/Korean/" style="background-color: white;">http://fsi-language-courses.org/Courses/Korean/</a><br /><br />Actually I accidentally found Making out in Korean. I went looking for a generic language book that someone had recommended and saw it. I haven't seen the series before and was a little confused. I only had the name to go by and that is was non-fiction. I was imagining this step by step instruction manual which is highly amusing. Especially since the topic is such a specific class of people. It turns out to be a decent phrase book I'd say. I really don't like most phrase books. If you want to catch the train you'll work it out. Relax. Talking to *people* though. That's the important thing. And that's what this concentrates on, even if it is mostly for picking up. And some of the phrases are&nbsp;hilarious:<br /><br /><ul><li>Will you marry me?</li><li>I'm sorry I just don't love you any more.</li></ul><div>Brilliant. The other one sucks due to it's absence of Hangul use from the start. Any learning material that ignores the native alphabet is such a waste. Luckily, it seems like you can just concentrate on the audio and ignore the book. That should be good for language shadowing. Still, these are things I would of liked to look at while doing TTMIK. They're not even close to a replacement. TTMIK, coupled with Anki is pretty awesome. Now to find a decent dictionary &gt;&lt;</div><div><br /></div><div>I've also found chat programs to be pretty cool when you're talking to mates. Now I'm starting to get broad enough that it's not tedious for the other person and vocab can be augmented with a dictionary pretty well. Then you can slowly build up the holes in your vocab and conversation at a less annoying for other people and more bite sized for you way before jumping into actual conversation. Stalling like that is not recommend I'd imagine though. And even though it seems to be working, I probably wouldn't recommend it to other people either.</div></div>
