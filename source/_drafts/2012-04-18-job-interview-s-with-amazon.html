So, ages back Amazon approached me to ask if I was interested in a job. I already had ^*&amp;^*n of adventure, excitement and travel so I didn't think I was interested, but it did peak my interest. I made it through their first programming test easy enough and they flew me to Sydney where they put me up in a hotel in the Darling harbour and I almost missed my plane flight home because I had decided that I wasn't leaving until I saw the Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera house. I somehow walked in the wrong direction and wasted most of my time there. Oh, my previous morning had been spent buying clothes and grooming myself since my darling brother had borrowed my car to visit our family and not returned it in time for me to get the required clothes etc. out of it. Oh yeah, I'd been living out of my car for about seven months at this point (I had a good job and money, it just kinda happened. It's a long story that I'm sure I'll add here at some point). Most of this is irrelevant to the rest of this point. If you're not a nerd and don't get excited by problems, turn away now.<br /><br />So, it seems like it could be a bit of a fopa publishing interview questions from a company like this, but at no point did they ask me not to. I'd normally ask for permission first but the absence of a reply to my email asking for any sort of feedback on my interviews (It was my first really. I've just lucking fallen into roles before then.) was absent so it seems fair for their to be an absence of me requesting permission. Plus, these problems were just fun. It's only fair that they're shared with people. Just a quick (*&amp;*B first. This was a while ago and my memory is quite shakey. I'd treat none of this as gospel. Also, it was the first time I'd worked with binary trees before. The night before I was like "ooh, better read the wikipedia articles before the interview". I had been doing some study coming in to it, but it kept getting pushed aside for Korean study or... what else was happening then? I think I was doing those courses that came out just before Educity.<br /><br />The first was emailed to me and I was given a time frame to solve it.<br /><br />Interviewer #1:<br />Some sort of sorting. References. Java.<br /><br />Interviewer #2: An Australian bloke.<br /><br /><ul><li>Two stacks to act as a queue.</li><li>From a sequence of integers, find the largest&nbsp;consecutive&nbsp;sum.</li></ul><br /><br />Interviewer #3: &nbsp;Trees? Binary Trees?<br /><br /><ul><li>Design question. He was a nice guy, but I was never 100% sure what he was asking. I was asked to design a poker game. I asked the application and what part I was designing but still didn't really get what he was expecting of me. I haven't done any formal UML for a long time and I guessed that's what it was. I answered in a bit of a mess, incrementally adding things until there was something complete on paper.</li></ul><br /><br />Interviewer #4: I really messed this one up. I just couldn't focus and was having issues with basic indexing boundary cases. I also approached an obviously&nbsp;reciprocal&nbsp;problem from a *^&amp;*^&amp; $%^$^&amp;. I guess it was because with the other interviewers I'd answered the questions, then given time/space complexity and finally been asked to optimise. This problem seemed simple enough I should be able to jump straight to the time optimised solution. Man that seemed to be a mistake.<br /><br />Sorting? Start end? Middle?<br /><br /><ul><li><br /></li></ul></div>
