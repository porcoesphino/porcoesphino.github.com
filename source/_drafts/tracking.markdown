 When I was younger I found some book in my parents bookshelf. It was called 5BX. It was an old school exercise book. It had these cool set of tables that you worked through "levelling up". I worked with it for a few years and really liked it. Eventually I dropped it. I tried to pick it up again after programming and decided to log my progress in a spreadsheet. That was tedious so I stopped again. I did find a pattern that worked for me though. Pushups and sit-ups after waking up and before the morning shower. Just one set and as many as you feel like. It worked. I tried logging them and stopped again. I stopped logging and started again. Recently I found the 100 pushups challenge that has levels and have been working through that. It works. I like it. I'm too lazy to flesh out something decent here, but this is my attempt at something for me. Something with a log and that tells me what to do and when. Hope it's useful to someone else.

I've been wantin to track my exercise again
 * Most systems lock you down
 * Tedious to use
Found some good ones
 * Data thrown away or can't send to other systems

Tictrac seems cool. Still, pushups aren't well supported, nor is sleepbot.

Moving away from a TODO list to a calendar:
 * for a while I wanted a simple calendar / time tracking piece of software to let me know when I was going to sport (payment issues) or when I was doing certain tasks (billing / where did my time go). New system, don't use TODO, it all goes into the calendar and the calendar gets adjusted.
