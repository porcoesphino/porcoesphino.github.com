One day Dale had the awesome idea that we should spend the day ferrying across the river to get beer on the other side... then ferry back to get more beer then ferry across...<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't work as well as planned and he got his nipple pierced before hand so by the time we got there it was the second last ferry. We will have to give it another attempt some time :(</div>
