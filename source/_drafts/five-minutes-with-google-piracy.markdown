I'm only willing to send a few minutes on this so the research is shoddy ;)

Aparently DARPA is making a more flexible launch platform for UV's. GIZMODO lists increases in piracy as one of the reasons. How much has piracy increased? I'm curious of that too.

Since I was born:

(World Ocean Review)
(why are pirates called pirates)
(satelittes and piracy on the high seas - the watchers.adorraeli)
(letters of Marque Issued by Year)
(ships, privateers - ships, continental navy - navy-privateer)

Wikipedia:
Not many numbers listed but The Golden Age of piracy makes it sound like there were a lot then. It was from the 1650s to the 1730s. It also states that Robert Davis claims Barrbary pirates captured between 1 million and 1.25 Million slaves to the arab world between 16th and 19th centuries.

This sounds like a huge decrease since the 1700s (impressive considering population increases and poor areas) but a definite increase in recent times.

So, clearly the pirates vs. temperature crowd needs to do their homework.
