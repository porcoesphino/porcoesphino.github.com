<br />A friend told me that she loved that saying: 'I was sad because I had no shoes, till I met someone who had no feet'. But couldn't really remember it and knew that the original was far better. So I did a quick search and found <a href="http://www.heartlandlibraries.org/news&amp;clues/archive/S2002/columns.html" mce_href="http://www.heartlandlibraries.org/news&amp;clues/archive/S2002/columns.html">a website</a> that said that it first appeared in a book called "The Gulkistan" or "The Rose Garden," written by <span>Shekh Muslihuâ€™d-Din Sadi of Shiraz </span>during the first half of the thirteenth century (1184-1292AD). In this collection of Sufi verse and stories, Sadi includes the following tale. It should be noted that this is an <a href="http://www.vt.edu/vt98/academics/books/shirazi/gulistan" mce_href="http://www.vt.edu/vt98/academics/books/shirazi/gulistan" target="top">English translation</a> from the original Persian text:<a href="http://www.vt.edu/vt98/academics/books/shirazi/gulistan" mce_href="http://www.vt.edu/vt98/academics/books/shirazi/gulistan" target="top"><br /></a>  <br /> <blockquote> I never lamented about the vicissitudes of time or complained of the turns of fortune except on the occasion when I was barefooted and unable to procure slippers. But when I entered the great mosque of Kufah with a sore heart and beheld a man without feet I offered thanks to the bounty of God, consoled myself for my want of shoes and recited:  'A roast fowl is to the sight of a satiated man Less valuable than a blade of fresh grass on the table And to him who has no means nor power A burnt turnip is a roasted fowl. <br /></blockquote>Of course there is the alternative: 'I was sad when I had no shoes, until I saw a man with no feet. That made me think 'I bet he doesn't need his shoes any more, and even if he won't give them away, it's not like he's going to catch me when I steal them'.<br /><br /><br /></div>
