<br />Last night I had three parties I managed to make it to, and had a blast. The first was a little short lived (sorry Claire, have fun though!)<img alt="Frown" border="0" mce_src="mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-frown.gif" src="http://bodey.ld.net.au/mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-frown.gif" title="Frown" /><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">and there was one before that which I bailed on&nbsp;</span><img alt="Cry" border="0" mce_src="mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cry.gif" src="http://bodey.ld.net.au/mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cry.gif" title="Cry" /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, the second was Nicks party with a theme of youthfulness, or something similar so it entailed playing childrens games. By the end of the night, I had gotten the hot japanese girls number who couldn't speak english, was older than me and was leaving in a week. On top of that another girl told me I was gentle (just after I told Lucy she was a bitch, damn Stef's influence), she then went on to invite me to japanese conversation class. Now it could just be me, but I thought that my being monolingual (read as bigotted Australian if you are Charissa) would exempt me from this wonderful event. When I pointed this out to her, she simply said that Nick could just translate everything for me... well... this is an offer I just can't deny. I'm going to have to talk to Nick about both events.<br /><br />Then on the way to the next party I was once again travelling in the boot... just like I was on the way there, even though I had the best idea of where we were going!?. Anyway, halfway there someone mentioned something about me jumping out of the boot while the car was travelling, and for some reason Stef popped the boot, so I did jump out, and sprayed most of her files across the road. We have some pics that I will have to add soon. I really should work out why it was that I did this.<br /><br />The last party was Dan Delucas younger sisters 21st. It turns out that Michael, a friend of mine, is also a friend of hers. So we got drunk. It started with me trying to get enough chips in the Blackjack to get a bottle of wine. I started with around 100, got to 400 then got bored and threw the game with 4 apt bets. Then we (Rachel, Michael, Randoms and I) played a form of ping pong involving skulling nasty drinks. Basically your not playing ping pong, your just trying to hit the ball into someones cup, and then they have to skull. The night ended with Rachel saying 'Thanks for enjoying my party' since I was by far the drunkest and loudest there.<br /><br />The next morning Stef only dropped me in the city since she was leaving for 7 weeks later that day and had a lot to do. On the same bus was this town girl and when she got off she obviously had no idea where she was going so I offered to take her to the Social Sciences Lecture theatre (where she was heading). Along the way I found out that she was selected as an ambassador for some Make Poverty History thing and that she was in year 12 and had two hours to kill before the event so I invited her to have coffee. I figured she had absolutely nothing to do, so after coffee I would invite her back to mine... nothing would be better then a big night out and then taking some high school girl back to mine the next morning after just meeting her. But unfortunately, she was 18 and on top of that along our way we also noticed some people who were lost so I offered to help them find the place. It turns out that they were part of the Make Poverty History event so she went with them and I cryed. The End.<br /><br />Oh, I also ended up helping some old Indian couple take a few pictures... so the year twelve girl must have been for the good karma&nbsp;<img alt="Tongue out" border="0" mce_src="mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif" src="http://bodey.ld.net.au/mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif" title="Tongue out" /><br /><br />Whoa... this post makes me sound like a sleaze bag.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I then went to eng to start to organise the paintballing only to find out that I have four days that we can do it in and that I couldn't get into the building even though I have four chunky keys for the place. So I broke in. I almost broke in though the workshop but I thought that was a little too dodgy. I really need to sort out my after hours access.<br /><br /></div>
