Me and Sproxton got drunk one night and thought it would be great to throw dares at each other. These varied from sticking our heads through gates (and getting them stuck), to climbing over gates (and wedging nipple rings between the gate and my chest), to jumping off the roof of Dominoes Nedlands.<br /><br />Turns out that 100% of the times that I've jumped of Dominoes Nedlands I've swooned women then gotten free pizza, coke and garlic bread and left them there.</div>
