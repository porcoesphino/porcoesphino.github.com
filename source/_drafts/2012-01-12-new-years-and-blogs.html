<div><p>I was talking with my mate from work today about stuff. What an anti-climax :P At one point we were talking about music and he said that his New Years resolution is to listen to a new Album every week. It's pretty cool I think. I'm guessing that this week was TV on the radio since he was complaining about bands that only have on good song, in this case, Wolf like me. Although personally I quite like Staring at the Sun and A method. And a far "better" band than what I've had in my head the last few days. Cher Lloyd - something something love which was preceded by Nicki Minaj - Super Bass. And it looks like I'm off topic again. So what would be on my ideal list?</p><p>Travel<br>Sky diving<br>Capoeira<br>Portuguese<br>Korean<br>Boxing<br>MMA<br>Tattooing<br>Japanese<br>Cooking<br>Dancing<br>Spend more time with mates and family<br>Improve professionally<br>Writing<br>Data structures<br>Algorithms<br>Design Patterns<br>Learn magic tricks</p><p>Hmm... and what are some highlights of the year?</p><p>Awesome trips to brisbane<br>Getting to know mates kids<br>Getting to know my cousins kids<br>Sky diving<br>Getting "kinda fit' again<br>Starting capoeira<br>Snow boarding<br>An awesome trip to japan<br>An awesome trip to indonesia<br>Learning that sometimes life sucks<br>Learning that things get better<br>Living out of my car for five months<br>Doimg my first tattoo</p><p>I think I'll finish on a couple of blog posts that I find especially funny. Bloggess snake and strange.</p></div></div>
