So, I've been eorking at cybertech for a year and a &nbsp;half now and since I've started updating this again, I gigured I may as well right about it.<br /><br />The atmosphere's pretty cool<br />cool toys<br />cool people<br />new music<br />learn a lot<br />work with a group of people who just like to create things. It doesn't matter if it's software, electronics or making a motorised bike using a whipper-snipper. They just like to build things. It's different to most of the people I spent time with at uni and, strangely, reminds me of growing up on the farm.<br /><br />Like my old job, this one's a bit of a cowboy op. It has the pluses, and it's minus's that go along with that.</div>
