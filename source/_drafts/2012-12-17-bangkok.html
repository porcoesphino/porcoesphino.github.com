<div class='post'>
I'd barely crossed the border into Thailand, actually I was still on the train I'd left Malaysia on, when I got handed over a&nbsp;business&nbsp;card of a lawyer on the train, incase I got myself into trouble. I'm not quite sure what he was insinuating, but them I'm quite the suspicious traveller in these circumstances. I don't like living out of a bag when I want most of the things to still be there when I get to my destination. It's an uncool change that happened somewhere along the way.</div>
