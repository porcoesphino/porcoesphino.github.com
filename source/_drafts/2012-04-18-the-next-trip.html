<div>I'm really starting to make some leeway here. I've even breached with convention and have some planning! This includes a map!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1NkB8WUWlTo/T47IN4pw1XI/AAAAAAAAEOM/rV5bEY1b3YM/IMG_20120418_214802.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1NkB8WUWlTo/T47IN4pw1XI/AAAAAAAAEOM/rV5bEY1b3YM/IMG_20120418_214802.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Look at the detail! The artistry!!</td></tr></tbody></table>Seriously though, I handed in the formal resignation today. I've studied huge amounts of Korean.&nbsp;Ah!! It looks like T will travel with me for a leg. We'll see if we can get Kat, Calin and Dale to meet us in Thailand before we move on.<br /><br />With the Korean, I've even almost caught up to the current Talk To Me In Korean lessons. I've hit it a bit hard though and the Anki reviews are getting a bit overwhelming. That will lesson over time after I catch up but I really need to start&nbsp;supplementing&nbsp;it with some more natural study like&nbsp;immersive&nbsp;and immersive drama or those Iyagi audio conversations and also some lang-8 / chats with Korean friends. Still, as painful as it is right now, it will pay off.<br /><br /></div></div>
