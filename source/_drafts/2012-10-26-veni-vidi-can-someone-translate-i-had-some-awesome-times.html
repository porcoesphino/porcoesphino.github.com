I'm going to start adding them to the blog. This is a song that was playing on the boat during the days I wrote this</span>.</div><div style="text-align: center;"></div>Travelling around a lot of people ask about your travels so I've learnt my short answer: "I wanted to move to Korea but didn't want to go straight there and after a few drinks with mates the rule was put in place that I can't use a plane to get there". It's not strictly accurate but it's close enough. For anyone who wants more, read on.<br /><br />This probably isn't needed, but still I've been asked enough "Perth's Awesome. Why Leave? And Why Korea?" that I figure some of you (Ha! Who reads this?) might want to ask but haven't. Truth is that I'm sitting in a boat now and the thoughts and thinking then seem like worlds ago. It's funny. Since I started travelling, memories from earlier times seem like a distant dream compared to the present. And looking at the other backpackers around, there is something to be said for stability. Travelling is nice, but it's just as big a trap as staying in one place. Which brings us back to the question. Why leave? Simply, it was time to. But I'll expand on that the best I can although some of the reasons are private and obviously won't be mentioned.<br /> <br /> Perth is a great place to live and it would be a great place to settle down and have children. I of course have no children (I think) so that in itself isn't really a reason to stay there. Add to that that growing up, I moved around a lot. If you ignore my time at university and the first six years of my life, then I've moved to a new town at least 30 km away every three years. Often it was a far greater distance and more frequent. And for one year in the middle of high school my family lived in a bus and we travelled around Australia. This means that a long time ago I started getting itchy feet (coincidentally, the name of our bus) about midway through university and wanted to move on, but felt it was foolish not finishing a degree and I really enjoyed what I was studying.<br /> <br /> I'd always planned on going travelling after leaving uni but just before I finished uni a few things happened and the plan changed. More than that, I was really enjoying living in Perth. Loving it even. But, part of the beauty of life is that things change and so did this. It was time to move on. I didn't quite have the money together yet and I got blindsided by a few things so I started saving, thought of some tentative plans, set a date for myself and started preparing. If the tentative plans still seemed reasonable at that date, then off I go, otherwise, off I go somewhere else :P After deciding to leave, the next thing was where. I wanted to go to Korea but was worried about what people would think and also my own head so I stalled to think about it a bit. <br /> <br /> I'd always wanted to go to Brazil, but my brothers (and now sister) all started having families (in March I became an uncle to my awesome nephew Corban; then less than a week later I had a beautiful niece Cara; then while I was writing the first draft of this post my as-yet-unseen nephew Leo was born; and, finally, my darling sister is starting to show) so I didn't really want to stray that far. The shortlist were really countries in Asia. I wanted the option to cheaply fly back for the weekend or a few days for a big event. The main places I saw for Engineering roles were China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. And all would have English teaching roles I could take up if need be. I loved my time in Japan but I wanted to go somewhere new and immerse myself in new ideas and a different culture while it's still easy to do so. That had also ruled out Australia. (Although I did toy with the idea of moving east. So many of my friends have.) Since I already knew a little Korean and had quite a few friends there, it seemed like a good choice. More than that, I'd just started learning Korean to the point where it was building on itself. I was becoming more and more interested in the language, culture and country. Actually, itâ€™s kind of sad how interesting I can find a language :P<br /> <br /> So then, came the preparing. I started amping up the Korean studies and saving properly. I hadn't had a good long holiday since I started the nine to five and I thought I shouldn't just go straight to Korea but I didn't have anywhere I really wanted to go (besides Brasil and now, Korea). The solution was to go from Perth to Korea via land and sea. The idea started years back when a friend of mine, Nick, suggested that we travel Asia together and get there by boat. This to me at the time seemed crazy and I had no idea how to plan such a trip. But piece by piece it seems to be coming along. I've loosened the constraints a bit be "no major airliners" since a friend challenged me to do a leg by hot air balloon and clearly helicopters are allowed. Not that either is likely to happen. Originally I thought of this as a loose guideline for the trip, but after some baiting by a mate from work (and spending so much time and money with the boat) I'll be damned if I don't make it to Korea while not using an airliner.<br /> <br /> I left Perth with a loose plan. Hitchhike to Darwin; catch a boat north; from there ferries, buses and trains should do the rest. From China though, there is a bit of a problem. I'd love to go the land route. There is a train line going from both sides into Korea. There are tours that go from both sides into Korea. There must be a way to get from one side to the other. Apparently though, I am mistaken. It should probably also be mentioned that the tours and trains have a habit of shutting down depending on the most recent incidents. Another option is a container ship which will be expensive but novel. And the last option is to ferry to Japan and back, but that will end up being expensive due to me wanting to see too many people. I should probably mention here that my preference is to get to Busan or somewhere that isn't Seoul and seeing a little of South Korea (plus sorting out the bank account, making a few mistakes, and polishing off my textbook Korean a little) before settling in at Seoul.<br /> <br /> And right now I'm drifting along on my way. A lot slower than I'd hoped but enjoying myself.</div>
