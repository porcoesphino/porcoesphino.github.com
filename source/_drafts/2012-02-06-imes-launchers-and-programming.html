Ever since I bought my first macbook I became pretty attached to using launchers. They just make so many actions on a computer smooth fast and painless. I still prefer Quicksilver on a mac although I've ended up using ** and Synapse on Windows and Linux. They're not of the same quality but do the job. Unfortunately, a lot of the key bindings overlap a bit with the programming auto-complete of Eclipse or Netbeans (presumably Visual Studio too although I haven't used that for a while). Then, if you use an IME to type in another language, you have another clash right there. I've not found a nice solution to this, but at least now I have a place to complain about it and maybe put up some solutions at some time.<br /><br />Mac:<br />Launcer -<br /><br /><br />Linux:<br />Launcher - Synapse<br />IME - SCIM<br /><br /><br />Windows:<br />Launcher - Launchy (creative!)<br />IME - Something Microsoft grown? I don't know, I haven't had the desire yet.<br /></div>
