To get started, just follow the setup in [boxen/our-boxen](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen) until you've run boxen once. Read the instructions but then mostly follow [gary's instructions](http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/02/15/puppet-plus-github-equals-laptop-love/). A few things I've changed:
 - Boxen takes a long time to run. Make your user config small and move applications to a project manifest.

I also [read a useful](http://coffeecupblog.com/2013/03/24/automate-your-mac-provisioning-with-boxen-first-steps/) guide on the Coffee Cup Blog. It's not bad as a primer but I don't advise altering the manifests/site.pp like that.

Finally, [Ross Lawley's post](http://rosslawley.co.uk/2013/03/automate-all-the-things/) like Gary's, talks a bit more about vagrant, a rather nice system to set up while you're doing this.
