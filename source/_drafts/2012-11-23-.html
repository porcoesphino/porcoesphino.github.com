<p>So, right now I'm in Bandung. The third biggest  city in Indonesia, sitting in an old internet cafe while new friends game and play music (Right now Fake Plastic Trees. A brilliant song). I'm even helping compose a song or two and going across to the local uni accommodation to make coffee's. It's a bit of an eye opener. I have been filling in the blog posts for the trip so far. Before I got here we were stuck at Day 2 &amp; 3 but I thought I should fill in some of this while I'm here. It's just the differences here. The uni was… well… relaxed? Informal looking? Although, they did have a helicopter and a plane! Where was my helicopter at uni? And they had a rock climbing wall!! I was pretty sure that the rope wasn't going to be all that useful since I didn't trust the structure to support me let alone a fall. Still, I was keen, even if my local friends even thought it was a bit on the dodgy side. Unfortunately, the climb I organised for a few hours later got cancelled due to rain. That was yesterday and it's forecast to continue until tomorrow. Actually, I should finish this post then. It will be more complete then. I should just make a note of the accommodation. It was interesting how… well… it was like a shed out the back of the farm. There wasn't  lot to it. The standard squat toilet with bucket / shower and a tiled room next to it with a gas bottle and camp stove. Everyone has one room with a mattress on the floor and a water bottle with cooler / heater. Rat's out side. And the girl there not only said I was handsome, but said that I was handsome because I was tall!! That's new. And the boy who took me there said something I've hear a few times in my short time in Indonesia "Today I realised a dream. I got to speak only in English. You're the first foreigner I've spoken to". Well… his English wasn't quite that good, but it's pretty good.</p><p>All of the stars are fading away. Try not to worry. I'll see you some day.</p><p>They don't think of us. </p></div>
