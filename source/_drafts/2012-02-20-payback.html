<div><p>A while ago i hurt my shoulder from too much capoeira and rock climbing. My friend is studying massage so i got her to help me. In exchange, I had to take her to dinner. She wanted to go to a Korean restaurant so I took her to a place I have never been in Freo. The food was nice. Her meal was better than mine. Then we went to the beach and talked. She is Japanese and has a special boy back in Japan. While we were walking along the beach, two boys made a fire and were drinking, so we joined them. They were both musicians and one was studying to research plant use by native people around the world. It was pretty interesting. He was really passionate which is cool. Urgh. I need sleep. I have a day off tomorrow but I will be using it to go to another job.&#160;Night everyone.</p></div></div>
