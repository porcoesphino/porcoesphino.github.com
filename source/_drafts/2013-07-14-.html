It's time to upgrade my mac and that means a new install. I jump machines a lot and I always wanted some config saved for later use and thought a few times about using git for this. With the Start Up course I'm doing at Coursera I found out that this had a name DevOps. So, now I have a simple repository for this. But, I'll also be reinstalling most of my software and that's a pain and time consuming. Can I simplify it? Well, some of it I can. This is just a note to <a href="http://vanderveer.be/blog/2013/01/02/automating-the-setup-of-my-perfect-developer-environment-on-osx-10-dot-8-mountain-lion/">read more about it</a>.</div>
