So, with my upcoming trip, and my relatively nomadic existence lately and my fondness for electronic toys, power is becoming an issue. In the short term, I'm buying a few phone batteries. These are almost required with smart phones these days as the battery can die during a night out. Especially if you get asked to throw up google maps or search the odd thing on the internet.<br /><br />Long term though, I want a way to recharge my laptop. My phone can be done through my car or via usb. &nbsp; The laptop isn't so easy.&nbsp;<a href="http://store.apple.com/au/product/MB441Z/A">This</a>&nbsp;is an apple product to power their macbooks during a plane flight. Apparently it won't charge them though.&nbsp;<a href="http://globetrooper.com/notes/solar-power-macbook/">This</a>&nbsp;is a pretty good blog entry on how to build up a solar charger from scratch for a Macbook. Mine is the air but I should be able to modify it.&nbsp;<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1419551?start=0&amp;tstart=0">Here</a>&nbsp;are some other points that might be useful. I'm not sure if I like the power supplies / solar panels they mention there though. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goalzero.com.au/shoppingcart/products/Sherpa-50-Adventure-Kit.html">Sherpa 50 Adventure Kit</a>&nbsp;seems like a better alternative. A few people also mention&nbsp;<a href="http://www.voltaicsystems.com/">Voltaic Systems</a>&nbsp;as a good place to source these types of goods.</div>
