I want to find a nice internet based travel guide. I haven't really looked for one yet, but I'm guessing I might not fit most target audiences. I don't really care about "the sites", nor do I really want to read a lot. Actually, I really want to know as little about the country as I can before getting there. But... I feel that's not quite responsible so there are a few things I would like to know. Things such as:<br /><br /><ul><li>Should you barter?</li><li>What animals will kill you?</li><li>How can you avoid said animals killing you?</li><li>What are some unique experience to get that are hard to find elsewhere?</li><li>What's one thing really wacky that you'll regret not seeing while you're there?</li><li>What do you do if you think you're going to die?</li><li>Are there landmines?</li><li>Will I likely get robbed?</li><li>Are there places I'm more or less likely to get bashed?</li></ul><div>That sort of thing. Like for Japan, it would go something like this:</div><div><br /></div><div>There are snakes in south-ish regions. No idea how dangerous they are. You can camp. Won't likely get robbed. You don't barter. No known landmarks. Apparently there are bears because mountain hikers wear bear bells. You don't barter. Onsen (hot springs), love hotels, maid cafes, cherry blossoms are awesome. Staying in internet cafes can be pretty cheap and you can charge electric goods and chat to mates. There are rumours of school girl underwear vending machines being there. Pretty whacky. I highly recommend living there. The people are awesome, but where aren't they?</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyone know anything?</div></div>
