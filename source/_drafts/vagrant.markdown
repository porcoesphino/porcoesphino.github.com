USB is tricky:
 * [A post on automatic USB configuration] (http://www.mindflakes.com/blog/posts/2013/7/24/mount-usb-devices-in-virtualbox-based-vagrant/)
 * [Gist linked to in the above] (https://gist.github.com/crazysim/c09924feb0830415a1d0#file-solution)
 * [A repo with a vagrant box using USB] (https://github.com/forskningsavd/forskmocom)

Useful commands:
 *	vagrant reload --no-provision
 *  * The provision file should probably be run and designed such that if it didn't need to be run it quickly finishes
 *	vagrant ssh
