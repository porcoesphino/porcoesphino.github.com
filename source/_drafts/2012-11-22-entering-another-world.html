<p>Now, you might think the title refers to my first time outside of Australia this trip and the crazy cultural experience. I did partially chose it because of that but mostly you'd be wrong. I'd been travelling with Diamond on the boat for a few weeks now and spending most of my awake time with her there in some way. (I was actively trying to sleep when the captain was awake.) Hell, the toilet was a piece of wood on the deck you picked up, the shower was a bottle on deck and the bath was the ocean. The only privacy you had was lying under the dingy on the cabin roof for what ever period you wanted to pretend you were asleep (and of course paying for it when you got woken up for your watch). We became like brother and sister. I hated her sometimes and thought she was great other times and we became pretty good at pissing each other off :P By this stage in the trip we were both actively avoiding the boat and waiting for visas. I had already almost left and become a reverse boat person but decided to stay largely because she said she'd feel more comfortable with me around and I was a large part of how she'd come to be on the boat. I'd decided I'd stay until she came to Bali and as much as we pissed each other at times and now had some freedom on the land we were still spending a lot of time together and I hung out in her world for a while. It was interesting. And I enjoyed it although it's certainly not where I belong. So, this is about the time we hung out in Gili Gede, Gili Manu, Gili Air and some of the craziness around that.</p><p>I should probably start with landfall after no sleep for a decent period of time. Damn. We entered the Lombok straight doing a little under ten knots (ten arc minutes of latitude per hour so ten is a bit over 18 km/hr) at a bit after midnight. By three am, with rag up and engine running we were mostly not moving backwards. This was to continue until mid morning. Yay for strong currents. Steve wanted to be prepared for when the tide swung so we didn't sleep. On the plus side, we finally ate the watermelon. A reasonably short time later we were at the still in construction Marina Del Ray with a couple of cold beers on the owners yacht with his guests. My diary says "Landfall!! 1:20pm". This is in Darwin time (+9.5). The next entry is from the next morning "Little did I know when I wrote that that we wouldn't be on land until 9pm and quite drunk &lt;snip&gt; We forgot to put an anchor with the dingy and we lost it". It was only missing for a day, but still amusing. </p><p>A lesson in patience; How much people with nothing can give; Awaiting a visa; Sleeping </p></div>
