... in the end the only reason I noticed that I was walking the wrong way was because I looked up at the southern cross and noticed that I was walking in the wrong direction. I could have read almost any street sign along the way... It was Albany hwy. ffs. So I used the southern cross to take a punt on which direction to walk in. I must have got it right because after a minor stop on some poor familys lawn I made it home.<br /></div>
