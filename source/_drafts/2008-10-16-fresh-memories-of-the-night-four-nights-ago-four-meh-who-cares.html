So the night started with going out as the wingman to the married guy who was going to buy me beer if I was a good wingman. Wait, not it didn't... not actually it did but before I got a chance to meet him I got invited to a Japanese dorm party and went their first. Nobody told me that it started at five, and I was running late so I got there around nine fifteen. I was also not told that Japanese dorm parties finish at nine thirty. These people suck. Not the whole race, just those that lived in this dormitory, so a bunch of 外人's and people who could speak pretty good English. Wait.. this wasn't the point of this blog... oh right. So, after being wingman and the married guy going home, I was... no after the dorm party I ditched some girls and a mate so that I could hang with the married guy. Then the married guy went home and I was left trying to find something to do. So I tried to find the cute girl from before. About 10 messages later I was walking home.<br /><br /><br />It was on my walk home that I saw a british flag on a second story balcony that had its lights on and decided this was someone who wanted to party with me. So, I was a little drunk... and the front door to the appartments were lock so I jumped the fence, climbed the emergency stairs and knocked on the door. It seems that this particular person doesn't answer their door at 4am on a Sunday. I was thinking that maybe the problem was that they hadn't glimpsed my winning personallity and that the best avenue for showing it too them would be to climb onto their balcony. I wasn't sure this was a good idea so I decided to shimy around the building - in the general direction of the balcony - while I made up my mind. In the process a silhouette decided to make its way from the appartment onto the balcony. It was around then that I decided to play it cool, pretend that everyone does this kind of thing, and walk on by pretending I didn't even notice the said silhouette. Hey, Jesse, I just used the word 'said' just like you've always wanted to. That was you, right? So in conclusion, I am a tool.<br /><br />To add further weight to this statement:<br /><ul><li>Yesterday I was walking home from the traino in the rain and saw a umbrella-less girl walking along. I waited for her and offered my umbrella. She walked along for a little while using 'すみません' as every second word while I tried to ask her where she was going. It turned out to be a line of people about two metres away with no rain cover above them. Since this wasn't my house I left her there in the rain without a second thought to:</li><br /><br /><br /><ol><li>being a gentleman,</li><li>making sure the poor girl wasn't going to get wet,</li><li>chatting to the girl,<br /></li><li>trying to get the girls number,</li><li>or anything else.<br /></li></ol>Sometimes I wonder if I'm really a man.<br /><br /><br /><li>Today my school had tests so I went to a primary school. It was lots of fun and the kids sung songs for me, gave a special presentation and gave me gifts... anyway... their teacher was kinda cute and I was too gutless to ask for her number or give mine. I'm not really sure what my companies policies are on this sort of thing since the mobile is not meant to be flashed in front of students, or even if this is relevant to this post but I wanted to bitch.</li></ul>So there you have it. <i>Quod erat demonstrandum</i>.<br /><br />PS. I was going to use the word やった！ in here somewhere but I can't remember where. I think I missed something...<br /></div>
