An Italian bloke and a Japanese girl. They'd been stuck outside of Fitzroy Crossing for two days and that morning there had been five of them. This was comforting since I was questioning whether I should have kept hitching. With them I travelled to Kununarra where I saw some more family friends in the caravan park. I was pretty impressed with how scenic the area was. We were a pretty shocking group for travelling together with all of us pretty U#@$@ and the result being that not many decisions were made. We mostly just drove through to Darwin without stopping. We did see lake argyle, drove through the night to make it to Katherine springs for a late night swim (the next day we met a French guy who had been waiting with them that morning and who I was soon to see everywhere in Darwin) and Edith Falls. When we finally got to Darwin I dropped them off on park near the bay on the side of the city. They were going to camp in the bush which I thought was ridiculous at the time but I ended up doing it a time before leaving. It's pretty common around there and called long grassing it and the beer run in this case is called a rabbit run. Then I decided to stay one night in a caravan park to clean up the van and messaged the friend of Romain that I was meant to give the van to. He told me that he was going to sleep in the beach and I felt sorry for the poor guy (only to sleep on the beach for half a week a month later) so I went to meet him and we cleaned out the van and snuck into the caravan park. He was a nice guy and we both were pretty amused by the fact that I a hitchhiker who Romain only knew a couple of weeks drove the van to him, also a hitchhiker who after getting picked up by Romain ended up working at the same farm for a month. We stayed in the van together for a couple of weeks until Romain came back and slowly did most of the crew that we'd left behind in Broome.</div>
