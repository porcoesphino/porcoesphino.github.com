<blockquote>The man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait till the other is ready and it may be a long time before they get off. -- Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></blockquote><p> As much as the above quote is largely directed at the boat, this post is going to about living in Darwin, the surprise that it was and the great people I got to share it with. The next post will be about the journey north in the boat and then I'll jump back to here to talk a bit about preparing the boat. I think telling things that way let's everyone's story merge into the blog a bit better.<br /> So, the title is a bit of a back reference to comments people made further along my travels. When we got to Gili Gede and the Gili Islands I kept hearing the word "paradise" a lot. For me, these places didn't earn the label. Beautiful, tropical, relaxing, lovely people, cheap. All those things and more. But I really don't travel for places. It makes travelling hard. Locations are nothing more than loose goals. People are what makes a place and Darwin was a surprising find and also not at all what I expected.<br /> <br /> **I need to say somewhere here that after so much time working on the boat there is no way in hell I'm not making it to Korea without using a plane**</p><div class="p1">Back then Darwin was pretty Awesome. We'd only just got there so it was still new and interesting. We'd spend the morning at the beach having breakfast together. I'd do my morning run down the beach and across the rocks followed by some push-ups, sit-ups and chin-ups. Next was the cold shower at the beach which I came to enjoy (I know! I never thought I could enjoy a cold shower. It must have been the graffiti: "Australia: Once a wild Nation"). Then sometimes we'd hang at the beach finding things to do. I don't think I'd laughed as much as I did the day we had the hola hoop. I've never seen so many people entertained by something that I'd previously thought was so simple. We tested how many people could jump through it before it fell, used it for high jumping followed by a roll, tried walking while doing it and finally trying to strip while using it. Goon bags were similar. If we weren't on the beach, we would dissipate into the city. Mostly to use the free internet at the library. Then we'd come back for the evening party and most nights they were huge. Then we'd head off in the van to find some side street and a house to pretend we lived out to pull up and spend the night. Rangers were out in force but they only ever handed out warnings so none really took much notice. That was to change though, but only after I stopped staying in the van.</div><div class="p2"> </div><div class="p1">My first few days in Darwin had a bit of a different routine. I had a goal and I finally knew when I would be in Darwin. So I started looking for boats that would take me. First I filled in any website I could find and next I hit up the yacht clubs. I was there for two days each drinking and talking and then put up my flyer. Basically it said "Want to go north. I have some skills. Never sailed. Willing to help fix boat since I will have lots of free time until I leave". And then I started looking for ways to fill that free time. I put up some ads for Korean or Japanese language partners or anyone wanting an extra for capoeira, soccer or rock climbing. I ended up meeting a Japanese guy once and we did some Karate training and language exchange on the beach. I did keep up a language exchange with two Korean girls who's ad simply said "we are two" (I'd assumed they guys wanting to increase the chances of an ad response but actually they were trying to decrease the number of "can you give me a massage" requests). I did a Mandarin language exchange since I thought that might be useful and at the time I had plenty of free time. These people soon became good friends as did the crew on the beach (which was frequently changing).</div><div class="p2"> </div><div class="p1">The day before Romain got back, I was walking along the rocky beach exploring and stumbled upon the rock climbing gym. These are too expensive in Australia for the budget I'd given my Australian leg but I thought I'd walk in anyway. Next thing you know I was offered a place to sleep so long as I help renovate the place. And this was no regular rock climbing gym. It had a playground that firefighters used to train in, a rope ladder and a children's bouldering wall. And then as fate would have it, on the night before Romain got back, the van broke. I'd just gotten offered a position on crew on a boat leaving if I helped fix it. My first full working day? That morning. The other guy? He also started his first full time job the next morning. Fun times. We arranged to get some friends on the beach to pick him up and look after him and give him somewhere to sleep until we could meet him and fix up the van. It was like that, there was always someone around to help fix something or cook. It was quite the community. The van was quickly fixed and I spend a few nights sleeping on the beach until I'd had a free day to help out at the rock climbing gym and then I started sleeping there. It was pretty awesome but I rapidly ran out of free time. Days were spent fixing the boat, early evenings spent either at the rock climbing gym or on the computer working on a personal project and attempts were made in the late evening to keep up a social life at Mindil Beach. The boat soon became the dominant part of my life while I was in Darwin (for a period a lot longer than I'd hoped for). And that section is another blog post. I did meet some amazing people and really enjoy my time with them. Quite a few of them are travelling through Asia now and I hope to meet up with them when I, eventually, get there.</div><div class="p2"> </div><div class="p1">*I didn't get as much climbing in as I'd hoped but it was still a great place to stay none the less and the people who also stayed there were all great people*</div></div>
