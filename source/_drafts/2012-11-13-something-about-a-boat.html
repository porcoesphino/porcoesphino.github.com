<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">Most of my remaining time in Darwin was spent fixing the boat so I may as well group that with the journey. The boat is called Anak Duyong. It was built in a small Malaysian town called #^*&amp;$@#. Its name is partly derived from that and can also mean little dugong. It's an old wooden Malaysian hull with a junk rig (sails of Chinese origin). The owner got it built it thirty years ago and has owned it since. He's lived in it a decent portion of that time and made many trips to south-east asia and back, usually bootlegging some beer or other cargo and taking passengers to complement travel spending money. It's a beautiful looking ship although when I first laid eyes on it it was a little on the unkept and cluttered side. Although I still fell in love with it straight away. There were not winches. All rope. At first, no engine. Very little electronics (Lighting minimal. Inverter is wired but only used for music. The bilge pump, the autopilot [simple magnetic heading hold via a extending rod connected to the tiller probably using a gear and blah with an electric motor] and the starter motor are the only other users of electricity besides myself. There really are way to many solar cells considering.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">The owner for a number of reasons had been trapped in Darwin for fifteen years and had been living in it on the river near Dinah beach. Head done a few things to prepare over the last five years but it was far from all put together..He was a tradie (carpenter) and had the foul mouth and pointless short temper that seems to so commonly go with the territory. (Especially in my experience, with shearers.) Working on the boat helped me polish off some more practical mechanical and electrical skills like I'd started working on with the vans. Although mostly it was experience in painting, motivating someone that was lost by a job they saw as too large and taking abuse. First we cleaned he deck and organised some things as well as getting some crap off the boat (There is still so much crap on the boat. It's crazy.). Next was preparing, painting and chaulking the cabin sides and deck. Then were the top sides (the hull above the water). This was a little scary as he wanted to run electric sanders from the dingy. We ended up moving to a beach at East point which was a pretty picturesque place to do the job and it was filled with friends (At that time everyone from Mindil beach got kicked out and they all relocated here). it was funny though because we had the police, council and customs all come up and question us about something we shouldn't be doing but we got away with four days without incident. Then came the rest of the hull. That was a little scary. Lying under a boat this size with little room sanding and painting and then painting anti-foul all while trusting the ropes and log holding it in. I wish I had a picture of how it was supported. Finally came putting the engine in, aligning it, adding an alternator, an extra bilge pump, building a bamboo shade on the back, patching the sailing, replacing the bamboo struts in the sails and redoing some of the rope work attaching them and other parts of the rigging, organising the ship and some odd jobs. All this while learning rope work, sailing and general practices plus a shiltload of odd vocabulary. Then came finding crew (a French-Canadian hippie in the end), sorting out permits, visas, arranging a time to meet customs, another meeting for the duty free fuel, and stocking up on food (perishables and fresh food). Finally though, it was all done and we were leaving. It was a good feeling. And I seemed to be getting just as much praise and congratulations as the captain. More even. Ah, I haven't mentioned any of the people down at Dinah beach! They were all great too! Special mention should probably go out to Chris $^%$ who was an exceptionally nice guy and, if anyone is interested and author with a few books out about his travels, life, adventures and sailing trips.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">The first few days were spent travelling to East Timor. The sailing went smoothly and the autopilot did it's job nicely. I quickly fell into doing the night shift since I really enjoyed the time alone on the boat, it meant I had to trim all the sails and to make sure the captain slept because he was intolerably grumpy if he didn't. During this time I also started studying constellations in the night sky which came in handy when the autopilot later broke and we had to hand steer. The day was mostly spent reading with a trivial watch and often a little food prep. The captain had a decent collection of books and I was starting to quite like David Lewis. The bloke's a champion. The rest of his books were various novels or non-fiction works on rope work, rigging, yachts or various voyages. The see life was amazing and pretty early on a got a new appreciation for video games! FIsh really did bubble out of the sea like in Age of Empires and the adventures really do have glowy trails leadinf off behind them (There was some sort of bio-luminestent plankton in the water that caused our wake to glow). We saw flying fish. Lots of pods of dolphins. Infact, the morning after my second watch, a pod came to swim at the front bow. I woke up the French-Canadian girl and climbed down the bowsprit to "swim" with them. There were so many, it was amazing. I've since seen an animal breaching and throwing onto it's side a few times (mostly they've looked like dolphins). I'm still waiting for a whale sighting!!</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">The whole time it was pretty calm although we did have a lot of rain on the horizon, a possible storm (weak I know) causing a strong enough wind from behind that we were going drop sail, but on the off chance it was a storm we decided to try and outrun it, a few splashes on deck, a fair bit of rocking throwing things about on nights when there was no wind to hold us in place and some long deep swell. It was all pretty calm though and not nearly what I was expecting. The hardest thing was not getting irritated by those around you. WIth the right people, it would be ideal. Amazing even. But we ware three very different people living in almost completely different worlds. </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">My favourite thing was moving along the decks around the outside of the ropes or climbing to the front of the bowsprit and I loved it when there was an excuse to climb up something. I only ended up on the top of the mast once.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">r</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">Small villages.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">Lost.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">The amount of reuse of materials was great. A little shabby in places but great. But the amount of crap that got thrown over was a different story.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">Bypassing awesome mountains, volcanos, cool villages, impressive waterfalls and Komodo dragons.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">Shitting and snappiness.

How awesome it could be.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">So much more to see and although it's been great (I've even wondered about getting a boat depending on how the next few years go) it's time to move on. Oh, I'm toying with the idea of not shaving until I get to Korea. Anyone with any input? And anyone notice anything missing in the below tentative upcoming itinerary (clipped at three countries)?</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial; min-height: 11.0px;"> </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Arial;">Next Up$ Indonesia: Dale's dad.
