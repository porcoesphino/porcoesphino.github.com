A few months ago I left my house opening my door as usual and walking out. As I exited my door a cherry picker became visible to my right. Looking up there was a neon sign above my head complete with dangling wires. None of this was visible from inside. Nor was there anything resembling personel, a warning or even something with a semblence to what I consider safety. This coming from the guy who sailed from Australia to Indonesia on a wooden boat with a questionable eperb that he helped fix for two months while getting to know the captain. During that time I ended up the top of the mast or the sail a few times on the old rigging also with limited safety but really, I question how many people besides myself I was putting in danger. This was different. It was on par with the captains idea to turn on the generator, and sand the boat using electric sanders from the dingy. I pointed out that we were going to beach the boat in a few days and we had other work to do in the meantime.

Where was I? Oh yeah. Safety over here. It's amazing. And obviously cuts certain costs to a project. Mostly the ones you see on paper. My kindergarten had bulldozers, excavators and hot tar being spread out the front of it for a week while the children walked past the various trenches being dug. I just can't imagine seeing the same thing in Australia. And I'm quite curious about the consequences of less regulations but I don't think I can easily find good numbers without better Korean.
