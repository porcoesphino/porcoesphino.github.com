Today I was reading the <a href="http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20070602/" mce_href="http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20070602/">2007/06/02</a> edition of the Post newspaper (my local), when I stumbled upon <a href="http://bodey.ld.net.au/images/stories/OCD_XMen/ocd_xmen.pdf" mce_href="images/stories/OCD_XMen/ocd_xmen.pdf">an article</a> on page 58 that not only likened ADD children to X-Men but also stated: <br /><blockquote> “Children with OCD, we’ve found, pick up thoughts, feelings, emotions and sexual energies up to 8km away in each direction. </blockquote>Now there were two things that went through my head when I read this... One was 'how the hell did they measure that!?'. The other was 'how the hell did the ethics board clear an experiment that involved children picking up sexual energy!?'. I'm just glad they were 8km away because that sounds more then a little dodgy. Since this guy was aparently a shrink, I was kinda hoping that he had some research published on the matter... of course finding a journal that would publish this may be a bit of a stretch, but I wouldn't really know, since I do computer science.<br /> After a bit of nosing about I think I found <a href="http://www.accessconsciousness.com/garyDouglas.asp" mce_href="http://www.accessconsciousness.com/garyDouglas.asp">the event that the article was talking about</a>although it did seem like it was a little overpriced and that it would be interesting to see what they actually teach the children. After clicking on a link to a related article I ended up with a page with no content... not a good sign. The whole website seemed just a little too polished. Then <a href="http://www.accessconsciousness.com/garyDouglas.asp" mce_href="http://www.accessconsciousness.com/garyDouglas.asp">his personal page on the site</a>doesn't mention anything about how he previously practiced as a shrink. Its too bad, I really wanted to find out more about how OCD children can pick up sexual energy from 8km away :(</div>
