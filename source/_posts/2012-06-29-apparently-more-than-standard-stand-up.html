Well, apparently wine tasting is a bit of a gimmick. Well, the paper '<a href="http://www.wine-economics.org/workingpapers/AAWE_WP16.pdf">Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better? Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings</a>' say's something like that. This is more of a note for me to flick through it later and... I figure I might want to find this someday :P</div>
