In the initial stages of learning, while the cerebral cortex is building up new nerve pathways helped by what is called the pyramidal system, movements are gross and clumsy. Once all the other support systems such as the inner ear and the eyes have caught up with the instructions for the new movement, then the extra-pyramidal nerve system comes into play, refining the movements and sending the new information back to the cerebral cortex.<br /><br />The sooner an awareness of the finer movements &amp; adjustments needed to learn a technique is developed, the quicker it can be learned. Research has shown that a part of the mid-brain known as the reticular system plays an important part in this process sifting through the rain of sensory information sent to the cerebral cortex and deciding on the best way for the body to act.</div>
