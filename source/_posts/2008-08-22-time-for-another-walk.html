It feels like it's time for another walk. I want to go to Okinawa but I'm not sure I have the money so I'm thinking I will start hitch hiking and see how far I get. I don't want to start in a city so I'm thinking about starting from Gifu or maybe Nara again. We'll see. I should be heading off Saturday after Capoeira.</div>
