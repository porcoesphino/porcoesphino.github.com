<a href="http://www.drhorrible.com/">http://www.drhorrible.com/</a><br /><br />Anyone else watching this? It makes me wish for a second season of Firefly again. Never going to happen though :(<br /><br />It also kinda reminds me of a review I was told about for Ash's song "Girl from Mars" where they said it was by far the greatest song about a girl from mars ever written and could only be surpassed if someone bothered to write another. I can't seem to find a reference to this on the internet so maybe it's just hearsay..  I heard if from HayHay... so..<br /><br />Anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Horrible%27s_Sing-Along_Blog" title="Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a> (Wikipedia article) is by far the best supervillian comedy musical that I've ever seen.<br /><br />So here's a quote. It doesn't give the "movie" justice, but my favourite quote gives some of the story away :(<br /><b></b><b></b><blockquote><b>Billy:</b> I want to be an achiever... like Bad Horse.<br /><b>Penny:</b> The Thoroughbred of Sin?<br /><b>Billy:</b> I meant Gandhi.</blockquote>Well... it over now :( But here's the trailer....<br /><br /><object width="400" height="225">    <param name="allowfullscreen" value="true">    <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always">    <param name="movie" value="http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1227202&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1">    <embed src="http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1227202&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="225"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1227202?pg=embed&amp;sec=1227202">Teaser</a> from <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/drhorrible?pg=embed&amp;sec=1227202">Dr. Horrible&#039;s Sing-Along Blog</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&amp;sec=1227202">Vimeo</a>.</div>
