I went to a theme park today, well not really since I'm writing this retrospectively but just look at the date it <span style="font-weight: bold;">says</span> it was written and pretend.<br /><br />So, it was <span style="font-weight: bold;">awesome</span>! It was my first time. It was for Rie's birthday, we had said we were going to go for a while and she said she really liked this place. So, on my first big roller coaster I almost shat myself, but it didn't stop me admiring how flat and artificial the reclaimed land looked whenever we went over a crest. Oh, and there were people on the some mud flats way off in the distance doing something, and I never worked out what. I asked Rie but she had her head in her hands for the whole rollercoaster ride, so she didn't know what I was talking about. I don't know how 'fun' and 'head in hands' are meant to be the same thing but hey.<br /><br />What else happened... oh yeah... the water park. That was a laugh. There was a slide where your falling vertically for a few metres, plus the tapering bits, and I was ok when I layed down but as soon as I hit that verticle bit my hands went out to grab the slide and stop me falling. It did nothing!! After a second I told my self I was a dick and enjoyed the rest of the ride. Ah, it was great.<br /><br />Ooh, there was this circle pool with a strong current that pushed you around. The current was the strongest next to a set of stairs, so you'ld let the current pull you round and then try to grab on to the ledge and pull yourself around. It was strong enough that you needed, nay I needed, most of my strength to pull myself in. Suffice it to say, I took out a few toddlers along the way, but I made it in.<br /><br />And they had one of those artificial beaches with artificial waves, but... me and Rie got there just as they were finishing. So we stuffed around trying to lift each other up and throw each other, but not before I tried to see as much of the wave making mechanism as I could... but it wasn't doing anything and I couldn't work it out :( I would have to just be a moving wall, right? And the force needed to move that would have to be pretty large, right? Just playing there with Rie was the best part of the day.<br /><br />Hmm... what else was there... ooh the thing that just dropped you, and the thing that threw you up into the air like a space shuttle, and the roller coaster with the loop-de-loop, and the roller coaster with the loop-de-loop that didn't start by taking you to the top of a hill, it actually started buy unsuspectingly slingshoting you and scaring the shit out of you at the same time. I think thats enough of a sentence for now.<br /><br />So, I was pretty tired since the night before I had played futsal I met a bloke who offered to take me out for dinner, maybe for a bit of English practice. He had lived in America for a while and wanted to be a writer but for now was working in the family business which was good for him since he travelled to see clients a lot which was writing and reading time for him. We ate at this thing where you fry meat on this BBQ infront of you and eat it. おいしいだよ！ One of the things that we ate was raw minced meat, with a raw egg with a slice of apple on top. It didn't taste too bad. I had to wonder how disease ridden it was. Anyway, due to this late night out I passed out in the car ride home, but woke up well enough to entertain Rie before she went home.<br /><br />I think thats all... The End?</div>
