I love backpackers. Butter, her boyfriend and their friends are great. Now I just need to work out what to get them as thanks. People that say "nothing" suck&nbsp;<img goomoji="softbank_ne_jp.329" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/e/softbank_ne_jp.329" style="background-color: white; font-family: arial; font-size: small; margin: 0px 0.2ex; vertical-align: middle;" /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So, I woke up yesterday morning and wrote out the last post, then did some Korean study, packed my things that had left my bag and started walking down the road with my thumb out. It wasn't too long until someone felt sorry for me and turned their car around to pick me up. Actually, I felt sorry for them. With the amount of sleep I'd had the night before, there was no way I was going to be great company. Luckily, he loved talking so we did fairly well. I convinced him to stop at one of the road houses so that I could have a real brunch unlike the two kiddie sized chocolate bars I'd had for breakfast. Needless to say, I've spent most of today preparing. Making sure all my clothes are clean and packed, buying a cheap sleeping bad and throwing away half the crap that made it's way into my bag. Well… mostly it's just half of my first aid kit and spending the $47 in loose change I was somehow carting around.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tssRFqYmFYE/T_wwZWTq4UI/AAAAAAAAEeo/I9s3_cnT8fA/s1600/IMG049.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tssRFqYmFYE/T_wwZWTq4UI/AAAAAAAAEeo/I9s3_cnT8fA/s320/IMG049.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I suck at poker</td></tr></tbody></table>I digress, back to the bloke who picked me up. He had a daughter who jumped straight in the back of the car giving me the front seat. I never know how to handle that too well but it's the norm so you just kind of mutter out a thanks. The bloke who picked me up was a Kiwi with a pet hate for the rivalry between the two countries. He educated me on a few points that I haven't bothered to check, like Farlap being from New Zealand and told me a fair bit about Carnarvon. He loved smoking, could no longer drink and had hitch hiked along the west and east coast when he was younger along with having done a bit of squatting. He'd apparently once done it with two guys who murdered someone who picked them up just for the cash in their wallets. Apparently you wouldn't of picked that they were capable of it but they were easily stupid enough to do something that…. stupid. So, after a brief stop at the cemetery, he gave me a tour of the town and dropped me off at my friends house.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I've now spent one night here and plan on heading off early tomorrow morning. It's raining now (my jumper was on the line outside) but should be clearing up by the morning. Wait! The rains stopped! I might try and get some stuff done in town before it starts up again!<br /><br />Oh. The plan is to stop in Dampier, Port Hedland, South Hedland, Broome and then... well I'll sort that out then. That is, presuming the plan hasn't changed by then.</div></div>
