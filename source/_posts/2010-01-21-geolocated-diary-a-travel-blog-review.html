I've decided to have a shot at a geo-located blog again. Ages ago I put together a hack job&nbsp;using yahoo tubes, google calendar and&nbsp;google mashup to kind of give you blog that you could navigate either by date or map. It didn't work very well, wasn't fun to put input data in, and I gave up fairly quick.&nbsp;Now google mashups doesn't exist anymore (<a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-calendar-google-maps.html">although a similar app does in google apps</a>) and finding my old google sites made me think: It's time; I'm going to find something that works. And so the hunt began.&nbsp;This time I'd also like it to be somehow compatible with google sites. At first it looked like a travel blog was the way to go. Sadly most of these didn't give me the navigation elements, or control that I wanted. And in almost all, I'd loose the data if they found it offensive. Really what I'm hoping for is just a blog that can have structured data for your location and a few other things like the weather, then also a few gadgets for things like making it navigatable via topic, calendar and map. Wait, lets put this into a list. They're always nicer to read:<br /><br /><ul><li>embedded map that:</li><ul><li>depends on posts</li><li>can be viewed like a trip</li><li>doesn't get too cluttered</li><li>can be embedded in individual posts</li><li>being able to clip what is contained in the map could be nice</li><li>isn't slow</li></ul><li>compatibility with mobile devices (ie. my android phone)</li><li>some other cool fields like weather</li><li>wow, that's not a lot really...</li></ul><br />But guess what? Blogger is adding geotagging!! Now all I need to do is to make a cool gadget or find someone else's. &nbsp;<a href="http://blurbbits.blogspot.com/">BlurbBits</a>&nbsp;seems like an early contender for taking information out of the blog, and parsing it into a navigation element. I think I'll go with this approach for now and let you know how it goes later. In the mean time I'll be reading a bit at <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">Google maps Mania</a>&nbsp;and reading through a few of <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/blogger/thread?tid=6b96ea66f7eccf2b&amp;hl=en">these ideas</a> from travel bloggers using Blogger.&nbsp;Since I've already done a bit of research into the travel blogs, I figure I may as well summarise what I've found too.<br /><br />Here's a list of the ones I found (I'll be editing this soon):<br /><br /><ul><li>TravelPod</li><li>Travelblog</li><li>Travellerspoint (really good for planning trips and getting info)</li><li>Travbuddy (seemed to have some promise)</li><li>Dopplr (had some cool maps build up of things people have liked, along with a mobile site)</li><li>Everlater</li><li>Bootsnall</li><li>Offexploring (hardly worth mentioning)</li></ul><div>I found a few different reviews. <a href="http://www.travelfish.org/feature/91">This one</a>&nbsp;gives a nice&nbsp;review of TravelPod, Travelblog and Travellerspoint &nbsp;but it's over a year old and doesn't seem very accurate when it talks about the maps but this seems common for these reviews. I think TravelPod just updated their mapping stuff, but then it would seem that Travellerspoint's was also nerfed.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tourcms.com/blog/2009/01/09/creating-a-trip-blog-how-would-you-do-it-pitch-your-ideas/">This review</a> goes over a few ideas in general for a self hosted blog. If you go to <a href="http://www.izunotravel.com/trip-journals-ranking/">IzunoTravel</a>&nbsp;you'll find a nice table summarising different travel blog features with a nice write up too.</div><div><br /></div><div>On a largely unrelated note, these&nbsp;<a href="http://www.designspongeonline.com/2009/08/made-with-love-found-terrariums.html">terrariums</a>&nbsp;are cool. I think I'll make one.</div><br /><br /><br /></div>
