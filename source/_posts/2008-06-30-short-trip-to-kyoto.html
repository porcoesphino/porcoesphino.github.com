<div class='post'>
I just came back from a trip to Kyoto. It was pretty awesome. I got to eat tofu ice-cream, cheese cake crepe, jelly Fanta and... well I'm sure there was more. Hmm, fermented soybeans, but I eat them for breakfast everyday so they don't count. Oh, I also had octopus and seaweed salad. Thats one of my favourites.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Soo, where was I? I don't really know. Alicia from Perth is in Japan so I was traveling with her. There was a problem meeting up with her, so my morning was spent trying to call her while walking around 名古屋 (Nagoya) train station. That lasted four or so hours. I was proud of my endurance. In the end she got her phone working and we met at mine. We had a feast, it was awesome.</div><div><br /></div><div>So anyway, we got to Kyoto around ten P.M. on Saturday night and found a nice little hotel. We wandered around that night and the next morning and got some good shots (that I still can't upload). I'll put them up when I can and make some comments about them. I left for home eight P.M. Sunday night so I paid ~$100AUD in transport for less then 24 hours. Still I had a great time :)</div></div>
