Ouch. I don't know how much sleep I'd had when I wrote this, but it was pretty horrible. Anyway, I think this is the time I was wandering around my local supermarket and I bumped into someone behind me and swiftly said sorry in Japanese. I was pretty proud because up until then I had to think about things like that. Sadly.. it was a foreigner and I'm not sure they spoke Japanese. This seemed to break my swing, because I later stumbled into a poor Japanese girl (yeah, I hadn't had a lot of sleep) and said sorry in English. The small victories, hey? Anyway, back to the original:<br /><br />This actually happened pretty quick. It was about two weeks before "はい" became reactionary. I was trying to sort out some bank things with my bank in Australia (and that was an effort) and ended up saying はい to the BankWest girl on the phone. Then wondering if she understood, which was quickly followed by 'what is she thinking? Does she just think I'm some 'tard!? Wait she's moving on! Dammit &gt;&lt; I stopped listening. Whats she saying now? Ooh.. she wants me to say something.." and if that fiction is anything like what actually happened then that could explain why that bank transfer went astry stranding me in おおさか but then, me not knowing how acurate it is would also explain the problems...</div>
