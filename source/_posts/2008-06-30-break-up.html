So, a few people have been asking why me and Rie broke up. Its kind of a long boring story really, but here goes for those of you that want to hear it.<div><br /></div><div>In Australia, I was the one who helped her and, well, I was the man :P In Japan that was always going to change and I knew that would be a problem. Actually, that and the fact that she would be going back to her Japanese life and friends made me think that we would be breaking up very quickly after I got here. We never really talked about this and well, she never brought it up over the break up, I'm just starting from the beginning :)</div><div><br /></div><div>So, a few weeks ago Rie started a new job, a few less weeks ago she began working nights. New Job = new friends + change = thinking. Nights = not much time for us to see each other and being grumpy when we do see each other. Also, she was about to start training for her career. So, thats more change, thinking and less time. And then she had a job offer on the other side of the country. So the same deal except even MORE thinking.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, I had no money and kept asking her to help me with mundane things like phones etc. This meant that most of the free time we did have together was spent sorting out mundane things, or with one of us sleeping. On top of that, I didn't have enough money to catch the subway to see her and she would always have to come and see me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, she was doing a lot of thinking about the future and apparently we are better off as friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hmm.. so when we broke up I asked her if she just wanted a break since all the reasons she was giving me sounded like 'need space' not 'the feelings not there'. But she was very clear she wanted to break up. Last week we went from broken up to on some sort of break, not much of a change really but maybe its something to write home about.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thats a pretty crummy explanation, but there you have it :)</div></div>
