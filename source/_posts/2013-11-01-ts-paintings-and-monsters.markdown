There's not much to this post. Being back in Perth I saw a few of his paintings. Made me want to put some effort into learning to draw again. We'll see if that happens.

I also found a post about Dave Devries work where he takes sketches of monsters drawn by children and paits them realistically. His book is called “[The Monster Engine][]”. It's pretty awesome, but as my friend said, isn't this infringing on the poor childrens hard work? :P
