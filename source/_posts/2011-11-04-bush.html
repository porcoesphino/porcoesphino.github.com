So, I've decided to start using this bad boy again. It should be a big of fun. It's looking far sexier than last time I saw it. This is going to just be a quick post to some links really. I started Rogaining with some mates recently. A friend recently started dating a girl who is quite into it, and I've always wanted to give it a shot. Not wanting to take the easy route, I started with the 24 hour event. We won!! Well.. we won the category we were in. The "I've never done this before" category, if you must know. We came 19th or 20th all up. Anyway, I just found out that the results online and figured it couldn't hurt to link them somewhere. For now, this is it. I may need to add some pics and find a better home though.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://wa.rogaine.asn.au/index.php/results/379-over-the-watershed-results">2011/06/20: Over the Watershed</a></li><li><a href="http://wa.rogaine.asn.au/index.php/results/391-dark-swamp-results">2011/10/16: dark-swamp-results</a></li></ul><div>Also of note:</div><div><ul><li>A supra is probably not the most functional car getting there.</li><li>Four ticks plus a huge one are uncool to have on you.</li></ul></div></div>
