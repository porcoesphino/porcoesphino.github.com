Only now, isolated and unable to communicate with the people around me can I begin to understand why Rie felt Moet was a kind giving person (I love ya' man, but you know... they're not the usual adjectives that come to mind)...<br /><div><br /></div><div>Here I have trouble telling the crazies from the normies. Even when they are talking to themselves I wonder if they are just holding a supertinybutcute Japanese phone or just practicing for the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game">LARPER</a> session.
