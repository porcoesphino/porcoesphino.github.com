My Aunty (well my mum's mum's sister), Ellen Barns, passed away around midday on Thursday the 14th of June. She was diagonosed with mesothelioma (a form of cancer caused by asbestosis) in May 2005. Since then she spent some time educating the public about mesothelioma and gave a talk at UWA for the opening of a new research centre.<br /><br />Sadly... what upsets me most about her death is knowing that I found most of this out from the internet <b>after</b>her death and I only saw her a couple of times since she was diagnosed. I wish I had thought to see her a couple more times even though I wasn't close to her. Even so, it is nice to know that my parents did manage to see her four days before her death. They made a trip to Perth just to see her.<br /><br />I have collected a couple of news items I found about her, the links here are local copies of the relavant articles. One&nbsp;is from the 2006/12/04 copy of <a href="http://uwanews.publishing.uwa.edu.au/" mce_href="http://uwanews.publishing.uwa.edu.au/">UWA News</a>, another&nbsp;is from issue 67 of <a href="http://www.intersector.wa.gov.au/" mce_href="http://www.intersector.wa.gov.au/">InterSector</a> magazine, and the last&nbsp;is from <a href="http://uniview.publishing.uwa.edu.au/" mce_href="http://uniview.publishing.uwa.edu.au/">Uniview</a> Vol. 26 No. 1 2007. <br />&nbsp;At the risk of sounding tacky, rest in peace.<br /></div>
